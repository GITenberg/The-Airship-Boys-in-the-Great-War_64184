</div>


<p>“Great Guns!” exclaimed Alan Hope, bending
down over the newspaper which he had
spread out upon the table in front of him.</p>

<p>Ned Napier, who was deep in a pile of blue
prints on his desk, glanced over at his chum.</p>

<p>“Great guns exactly describes it, if you’re
reading those accounts of the war in Europe,”
said he with a grin, “or maybe you’d better say
the great-<em>est</em> guns, because that’s what they are
using over there just now. But then, we shouldn’t
worry as long as they aren’t shooting up the
good old Stars and Stripes.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it, Ned; we <em>should</em> worry,”
answered Alan, his face puckered into unaccustomed
wrinkles, and his eyes still swiftly
scanning the pages of the newspaper before
him. “We ought to worry about this piece of<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
news, because it concerns a mighty good friend
of ours.”</p>

<p>“Who! How’s that? Where is it?” cried
Ned, swinging around in his swivel chair so
as to face the other boy. Seeing that Alan was
still staring as if bewildered at the paper, he
arose and hurried over to the table. Leaning
down over Alan’s shoulder, he at first could
only see flaring headlines of three and four-inch
black-faced type.</p>

<p>As Ned’s eye roved down the outspread
sheet, however, it finally was caught by a smaller
sub-head, sandwiched in between reports on the
latest scandal on the Subway Investigation and
alleged atrocities in Belgium. He gave a gasp
of mingled astonishment and consternation as
he read the following:</p>

<p class="center">“AMERICAN WAR CORRESPONDENT IN
PRISON</p>

<p class="center">“Will Be Tried as a Spy!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Associated Press Syndicate, Muhlbruck, via
Brussels, November 13, (Delayed by censor).&mdash;Robert
Russell, said to be an American newspaper
man, has been arrested here and put under
guard, pending trial as a spy by Gen. Haberkampf,<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
commanding the division of the West
Battalion. The Germans are taking every precaution
to safeguard the secrecy of their maneuvers,
and this arrest is said to be only one
of their determined efforts to discourage the
presence of alien war correspondents. Russell
is in grave danger of being shot unless he can
satisfactorily explain certain papers found upon
his person at the time of his arrest.”</p></div>

<p>No wonder that both Ned and Alan turned
pale and looked at each other in a dazed,
stupefied sort of way. Bob Russell was one of
their oldest and dearest comrades, a lad only
slightly older than themselves, who had gone
through innumerable adventures with them. He
had so often accompanied them in sensational
exploits, that his name was often linked with
theirs: The “Airship Boys.” He had accompanied
them on the famous twelve-hour flight
of the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> from London to New York;
he had braved death with them in Mexico when
the Airship Boys put a stop to the smuggling of
Chinamen into this country; he had proved himself
an intrepid comrade when they had dared
wild Indian tribes in Navajo land in search of
the hidden Aztec temple; he had risked death
with them on their dash for the North Pole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[12]</span></p>

<p>The Airship Boys and their adventures have
been written up in newspapers and books and
Bob Russell was no small factor in the success
of his friends.</p>

<p>Bob Russell! As tried and true a comrade
as ever a boy had&mdash;always cheerful, full of
expedients, and “game” to the core. They
could hardly realize that it was he who was
now threatened by such frightful death, without
a single friend near to aid him.</p>

<p>“Poor Bob!” exclaimed Alan, and was not
at all ashamed of the unaccustomed lump that
crowded further speech from his throat. “Poor
Bob!” he repeated.</p>

<p>Ned had dropped his face into his hands and
with closed eyes mentally pictured the crowded,
ill-smelling prison where Bob sat unshaven and
forlorn, surrounded by other wounded and miserable
beings who felt no sympathy for him nor
even spoke his language&mdash;who only shrank with
wide, scared eyes from the suspicious glare of
the armed Germans on guard. Maybe Bob was
thinking of him too just then, wondering what
the Airship Boys were doing, picturing them
skimming luxuriously out over the sun-kissed
ocean in careless forgetfulness of him, their
devoted comrade of past days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>Alan interrupted Ned’s mournful imaginings
again.</p>

<p>“Just think,” he cried, “of all the terrible
barbarities which the newspapers say that the
Germans have inflicted upon their captives.
Think, they may perpetrate some similar awful
atrocity upon poor old Bob!”</p>

<p>Ned shook his head impatiently.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe they would do anything
like that,” said he. “Two-thirds of these torture
and massacre stories we read about are
hysterical exaggerations, prompted either by
their enemies or newspaper writers with a lively
imagination. The Germans are a kindly, civilized
people, just as the English or French, and
certainly more so than the Russians. If they
shoot Bob it will be because they honestly
believe him to be a spy.”</p>

<p>“But they mustn’t shoot him! It must be
stopped some way!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but how? If all of the influence that
Uncle Sam can exert won’t protect him, what
can?”</p>

<p>“<em>We</em> can, Ned. There is no time to wait
for diplomatic negotiations, which may accomplish
nothing anyway. Remember that this
newspaper says that certain incriminating papers<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
have been found on Bob’s person. If he is to
be saved it must be done immediately and by us
two alone. We can take the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> and
reach Belgium in twenty or twenty-one hours,
just as easily as we made that trip from New
York to London in eighteen hours last year.”</p>

<p>“I admit that we can get there soon enough,”
answered Ned, “but what about the third man
whom we’ll need to help us manage the airship?”</p>

<p>“Why not ‘Buck’ Stewart, who went with
us on the <em>Flyer’s</em> trip to London? We know
that he is absolutely dependable, and is familiar
with the workings of the ship besides. Then,
too, the <cite>Herald</cite> will be more than glad of the
chance to send one of its reporters with us to
see the war at close range.”</p>

<p>Alan’s intense enthusiasm began to communicate
itself to the slower-thinking, more practical
Ned, but he was not ready to act without mature
consideration of all the difficulties involved which
might make a failure of their attempt.</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to think me lukewarm
about doing anything in our power to save
Bob,” said he, “but we’ve got to look carefully
at all sides of this thing. Don’t you
realize that the United States government
wouldn’t sanction any high-handed breaking of<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
neutrality laws that might drag it into the war,
just because an American citizen was held
captive?”</p>

<p>“Then let’s go without the government’s
permission! Who is there to stop us? We can
get enough credentials from Mr. Latimer, managing
editor of the <cite>Herald</cite>, to tide us over small
passport difficulties, and further than those we
certainly can depend upon ourselves. We won’t
have to flaunt the Stars and Stripes under the
nose of every foreigner we happen to meet over
there anyway. Remember what Senator Bascom
said in his speech on the Mexican war: ‘If the
life of a single United States citizen is at stake,
it is worth all of the millions of mere money
that international war may cost us.’ We can’t
desert good old Bob in an emergency like this,
can we?”</p>

<p>“No!” shouted Ned, jumping to his feet and
banging his fists on the desk in front of him.
“You’re right, Alan. We’re going to show
those chaps over there that it’s not such ‘a
long, long way to Tipperary,’ after all, providing
one can travel in the Airship Boys’ <em>Ocean
Flyer</em> at the rate of two hundred miles an hour.
Get on your hat and overcoat, Alan! We’re
going over to the <cite>Herald</cite> office right now to see<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
what the editor of the <cite>Herald</cite> will do for us.”</p>

<p>“Hip, hip, hurrah!” shouted Alan, and
grabbing Ned’s out-stretched hands they did a
truly boyish war-dance around the sober, stately
offices of the Universal Transportation Company,
of which they were the heads.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN THE OFFICES OF THE NEW YORK HERALD</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The managing editor of the New York <cite>Herald</cite>
received the engraved visiting cards of Alan
Hope and Ned Napier with mingled pleasure
and surprise.</p>

<p>“The Airship Boys! Send them right in,”
said he to the young woman who had announced
them from the outer office. Then the great
newspaper man turned with an apologetic smile
to the gentleman who still stood, hat in hand,
beside his desk, as he had been about to leave
just before the boys’ cards were brought in.</p>

<p>“Please excuse me, Mr. Geisthorn, for seeming
to hurry you away in this manner, but I
believe our little interview was about terminated
anyway.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is so,” replied the other, speaking
with a strong German accent. “It is not for me
yet to take too much of your precious time. As
I have before said, I am myself a journalist, and
know the value of even a minute’s time.”</p>

<p>The editor of the <cite>Herald</cite> arose to shake hands<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
in parting with his visitor. At the door the
latter turned, hesitated momentarily, and then
said:</p>

<p>“My excuses again, mein herr, but what was
it that you called these gentlemen? The Aeroplane
Children? What is that?”</p>

<p>The managing editor permitted a smile to edge
his lips as he turned and pointed to a framed
front page of the <cite>Herald</cite>, dated over two years
ago. It was double headlined in heavy, black-letter
type, and profusely illustrated with photographs
of the coronation of King George V of
England.</p>

<p>“I called them the Airship Boys,” said the
editor. “That is a title they have won as a
result of their astounding feats and innovations
in aerial navigation. The page of the <cite>Herald</cite>
which you see there on the wall represents a bit
of newspaper history as well as the beginning
of a new epoch in aeronautics. Those two young
men, Ned Napier and Alan Hope, two years
ago last June accomplished a flight from London
to New York in twelve hours, bringing back
with them photographs of the coronation ceremonies,
and enabling us to publish them nearly
a week earlier than any other American newspaper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[19]</span></p>

<p>“London to New York in <em>twelve hours</em>!
Impossible!” ejaculated the visitor, gaping at
the picture.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder at your surprise,” responded
the managing editor, “but that’s exactly what
they accomplished in their <em>Ocean Flyer</em>&mdash;the
largest and highest-powered aircraft ever devised&mdash;a
vessel capable of carrying six or seven passengers
at a consistent velocity of two hundred
miles and more per hour; an airship which can
be easily operated at a height of eight or ten
miles, where the driver of any other machine
would either freeze to death or die from lack
of oxygen.”</p>

<p>“You are not what you call making funnies
of me?” queried the astounded visitor, blinking
at the editor fixedly through narrowed eyelids,
as if to read his inmost thought. “All
this that you tell me is true then?”</p>

<p>“Sir!” said the managing editor with a
touch of temper.</p>

<p>“Pardon, mein herr; I do not mean to
offend, but&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mr. Napier and Mr. Hope,” announced the
private secretary from the doorway.</p>

<p>Ned and Alan appeared, hat in hand, and were
cordially greeted by their newspaper friend.<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
As they entered the room, the earlier visitor
brushed past them on his way out, staring almost
rudely in each boy’s face as he passed.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Alan, when the door clicked
shut behind the man, “I hope whoever that is
will know us the next time he sees us.”</p>

<p>The managing editor laughed as he waved his
guests to seats and offered them cigars, which
both boys refused with thanks.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to excuse Mr. Geisthorn, boys,”
said he. “He is a newly appointed local correspondent
for the <cite>Tageblatt</cite>, and I nearly
floored him with an account of that London-to-New
York flight of yours.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he was a German then,” said Ned,
exchanging a significant glance with Alan.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, and seems to be a very nice
fellow from what little I know of him. He
arrived in this country only shortly after the
war broke out and seems quiet and inoffensive,&mdash;never
gets excited over the war news nor
yells Bloody Murder when the ‘Vaterland’ is
mentioned. He calls here every now and then
to give me interesting bits of news which filter
through to him but are cut out of the <cite>Herald’s</cite>
regular Berlin cable service by the censor. Ever
since our Mr. Russell got into difficulties over<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
there we haven’t been able to get anything like
the exclusive copy we used to.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what we’re here to see you
about, sir,” Ned remarked. “We read in this
morning’s papers how Bob has been imprisoned
as a spy and is liable to be shot at any minute.
President Wilson naturally doesn’t want to
embroil the United States unnecessarily in the
war, and Bob may be backed up against a wall
with the firing squad aiming at him before this
‘watchful waiting’ policy evolves any means of
interceding in his behalf. Something must be
done to help him right away.”</p>

<p>The lines of care around the great journalist’s
mouth deepened with melancholy as he nodded.</p>

<p>“The <cite>Herald</cite> has of course registered a formal
protest. We can do no more,” he said. “The
life of a single individual doesn’t seem such a
very big thing to war-crazed men who are blinded
with cannon smoke and have been literally wading
through human blood for three months past.
We can get no satisfactory answer of any sort
from the German field headquarters. The most
that they will promise is that the affair will be
investigated and rigid justice meted out.”</p>

<p>“But, hang it all&mdash;” broke in Alan, only
to be silenced by the calmer, more practical<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
Ned. Pulling his chair closer to the editor’s
desk and lowering his voice, he explained:</p>

<p>“Alan and I feel that for Bob’s sake we
can’t afford to take chances on any such vague
promises as have been given you. We propose
to rescue him ourselves and without a moment’s
unnecessary delay.”</p>

<p>“But how can&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Sh! In this case we must be careful that
we aren’t overheard. There might be some
German sympathizer about who would send word
of our plans, or, on the other hand, even the
federal government agents would interfere if
they got wind of our scheme.”</p>

<p>“You are right,” answered the managing
editor.</p>

<p>He pressed the electric button on the side of
his desk, summoning the young lady secretary
from the outer office.</p>

<p>“Miss Bloomfield, is there anyone out there
waiting to see me?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good! Kindly contrive to knock the big
dictionary off your desk the moment anyone
comes in, so that I may be warned of any visitors
without their knowing it. That is all.” She
closed the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[23]</span></p>

<p>“Now, boys.”</p>

<p>Ned resumed his explanation.</p>

<p>“The <em>Ocean Flyer</em> is still there in the hangar
of the Newark plant of the Universal Transportation
Company. Neither Mr. Osborne, president
of the company, nor Major Honeywell, the
secretary, have any financial interest in the
airship. It belongs absolutely to Alan and me,
and we intend to use it immediately for the trip
to Muhlbruck, where we understand that Bob
is awaiting trial.</p>

<p>“The <em>Flyer</em> is in the best of condition and
almost ready for use at any moment. All that
we need to do is to equip her with a few
mechanical supplies, food, firearms, and so on.
We can make the trip in less than twenty hours.
To-day is Tuesday. If all goes well, we can
have Bob back here ready to go out on a city
assignment for you by next Monday.”</p>

<p>Wrinkles of deep thought lined the great newspaper
man’s forehead as he listened attentively
to the brief outline of the Airship Boys’ plan.
He would have met such statements from any
other boys not yet twenty-one years old with
absolute ridicule, but he knew that, despite their
youth, Ned Napier and Alan Hope were fully
capable of carrying out their scheme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[24]</span></p>

<p>“One thing more, though, boys,” said he,
after a short period of silence. “Just how are
you going to get Mr. Russell out of prison after
you arrive in Muhlbruck? You won’t be able to
overpower a whole German garrison, you know.
Then, too, the chances are that when they see an
airship of such unusual design as yours floating
down upon them, they’ll recognize it as being of
foreign construction and fire upon you.”</p>

<p>Alan answered him:</p>

<p>“We haven’t had time to plan that far ahead
yet; we’re going to let that part of it take care
of itself. We’ll have to be governed by circumstances
after we get there anyway.”</p>

<p>“And in regard to their firing upon us as a
hostile airship,” supplemented Ned. “I think
the chances are that they may take us for one
of their new types of dirigibles that Count Zeppelin
is said to have almost ready for a big
aerial raid upon England.”</p>

<p>The editor smiled a bit sadly at their shining
eyes and enthusiastic faces. Then he shook his
head.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that even a German private
could mistake the unusual build of the <em>Ocean
Flyer</em> for the bologna-shaped gas bag of a Zeppelin,”
said he. “Still, you are very brave boys,<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
and I want to compliment you sincerely upon
your pluck in attempting this thing. All luck
go with you. Now, what is it that you came here
to have me do in your behalf?”</p>

<p>“Just this,” said Ned. “We would like to
have you furnish us with full credentials as war-correspondents
for the New York <cite>Herald</cite> to protect
us from petty annoyances in case we should,
for some unforeseen reason, have to abandon
the <em>Flyer</em> and make our escape on foot. We
promise you that the passports will not be used
in any way that might implicate the paper
in a breach of neutrality courtesies, and, anyway,
we’re not going to do any actual fighting if we
can help it.</p>

<p>“Also, we would like to have a personal letter
to General Haberkampf, the German commandant
at Muhlbruck, explaining that Bob Russell is
an authorized and fully-accredited representative
of the <cite>Herald</cite>, and the last person in the world
to be concerned in secret service for the Allies.”</p>

<p>“Certainly you shall have all that you ask
for,” cried the managing editor. “And here’s
hoping that you make that bigoted old General
Haberkampf come to his knees with&mdash;”</p>

<p><em>Crash!</em></p>

<p>Further utterance froze on the editor’s lips<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
and both boys sprang startled to their feet. Miss
Bloomfield’s big dictionary had fallen to the floor
with a bang in the outer office!</p>

<p>The editor strode to the private door just as
it was pushed open by none other than Mr.
Geisthorn, the new correspondent for the <cite>Berliner
Tageblatt</cite>. Miss Bloomfield’s face showed
angrily over his shoulder.</p>

<p>For a breathless moment all four of those in
the private office stared quizzically at each other.
The German was the first to recover his
composure.</p>

<p>“Excuse, gentlemen,” said he, bowing low to
each in turn, “I did not mean to interrupt, but
did I not leave my gloves there on the desk?”</p>

<p>“I think not, sir,” replied the editor gravely.
“Come in. You do not interrupt us. My conference
with these gentlemen is already concluded.
Mr. Napier, Mr. Hope, good day. I
shall send you by boy this afternoon the copies
from our files about which you inquired. Good-bye!”</p>

<p>As the Airship Boys passed out of the office,
Mr. Geisthorn again bent upon them his peculiarly
disconcerting stare. They remarked that
his pale blue eyes were as hard and cold as
steel.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">SOMEONE TRIES TO BUY THE “FLYER”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Well, young men, I’ve good news&mdash;truly
surprising news for you,” said Major Baldwin
Honeywell, as he shook hands with Ned and
Alan the next morning when they returned to
the offices of the Universal Transportation
Company.</p>

<p>“We hope that you’re right, Major,” answered
Ned. “What is the good news?”</p>

<p>“First let me ask you a question. How much
did it cost you to build the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> and at
what figure do you estimate the time you spent
upon it, the only model of its kind yet completed?
Your mechanism, parts, et cetera, are,
of course, fully protected by international patents.
The question is simply: For how much
will you sell the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> just as she stands
there in our Newark factory?”</p>

<p>“The machine itself cost us about twenty-five
thousand dollars, Major. I should say that the
market value of the craft itself, allowing compensation
for our time and the fact that the<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
airship is absolutely unique, ought to make it
worth at least a hundred and fifty or two hundred
thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>Major Honeywell was rubbing his hands
delightedly.</p>

<p>“Fine, fine! I knew that you would estimate
it at about that amount. Boys, what do you say
to a prospective purchaser who is willing to pay
three hundred thousand dollars spot cash for
this single model, leaving the company full patent
and all further construction rights?”</p>

<p>“But the machine isn’t for sale at any price,”
said Alan quietly. “We intend to use it ourselves
immediately, and until we are finished
with it, no consideration would tempt us to sell.”</p>

<p>“But, Alan&mdash;boys!&mdash;think of the sum you
are offered: twelve times the actual cost, if the
new owners are given immediate possession, and
providing you agree not to dispose of another
similar machine within a period of one year.
You can build another airship just like the <em>Flyer</em>
within two or three months at the longest, and
you are at liberty to use it yourselves as you
may please. To what immediate use can you
put the vessel that will in any way compensate
for the loss of three hundred thousand dollars
in cold cash?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[29]</span></p>

<p>“Major,” said Alan, “we are deeply grateful
for your interest in the matter, but we feel that
we can’t look at it as a mere matter of dollars
and cents just now. Something a great deal more
valuable to us is at stake&mdash;the life of Bob Russell,
whom you know.”</p>

<p>Then Alan went on to tell Major Honeywell
all about Bob’s predicament and how they proposed
to save him. The old gentleman’s face
grew more and more grave as he listened, and
several times he shook his head disapprovingly.</p>

<p>“But, my dear boys,” he exclaimed, after
Alan had concluded outlining their plans, “have
you sufficiently considered the terrible dangers
that you incur by this rash procedure? Quite
aside from the momentary probability of aerial
mishap, you must realize that the Germans would
shoot you without scruple under the circumstances.
Moreover, the entire United States
government would be powerless to help you if
once you were caught in a breach of neutrality
laws, as your act certainly would be construed.”</p>

<p>“Thank you kindly for the well-meant word
of caution, Major,” answered Alan, “but there
is nothing you could say which would make us
give up this chance of saving poor Bob’s life.”</p>

<p>“Then, if that is the case, here is my hand,<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
boys, and my heartiest well wishes go with you.
While I cannot conscientiously endorse so dangerous
a proceeding, I still can admire the pluck
which prompts it.”</p>

<p>Both boys flushed under their kindly old
friend’s praise, and Ned, who up to this time
had played the part of a listener, said:</p>

<p>“Just who were these prospective purchasers
of the <em>Ocean Flyer</em>? Why did they insist on
taking immediate possession of it, and why the
stipulation that we were to sell no other similar
airship to anyone else within one year’s time?”</p>

<p>Major Honeywell shook his head.</p>

<p>“I am as much in the dark in that regard as
you are, Ned. Just before you arrived this
morning, I was visited by a Mr. Phillips, whose
business it is to act as go-between and buyer for
concerns which do not wish their own names to
appear in a transaction. Mr. Phillips would not
state for whom he was acting or for what purpose
the <em>Flyer</em> was to be used, but said that he
was authorized to pay spot cash for it. He
seemed to be very much excited and anxious to
close the deal at once.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose that he could be representing
one of the belligerent countries in Europe
and wanted the <em>Flyer</em> for war?” asked Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p>This was a new thought to Alan, who slapped
his knee, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“I’ll bet that’s the whole secret. The war
departments over there are all wild over this
armored aeroplane idea anyway. England probably
wants the <em>Flyer</em> to protect her from air
invasion by Germany.”</p>

<p>“Or France wants it to use in dropping bombs
along the western battle front in Belgium,” said
Major Honeywell.</p>

<p>“Or maybe Germany wants it to supplement
their rumored fleet of Zeppelins for the long-planned
raid on England,” added Ned.</p>

<p>All three could not help but laugh heartily at
the diversity of opinions thus expressed. In the
midst of their merriment the telephone on Major
Honeywell’s desk began suddenly to ring
insistently.</p>

<p>“Hello,” called the Major, with the receiver
to his ear. “Yes, yes. This is the offices of
the Universal Transportation Company, Major
Baldwin Honeywell, the treasurer, talking....
What?... Speak a little louder and more
slowly, please; I can hardly understand you....
Yes.... Mr. Phillips approached me about
the sale of the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> this morning....
Oh! you are speaking for him. I see.... No,<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
we have decided not to sell the airship.... No,
<em>not</em> to sell it.... No, no, the price was quite
gratifying, but the <em>Flyer</em> is not for sale....
Positively, sir!... You are wishing to give
twenty-five thousand dollars more?... Hold
the wire.”</p>

<p>Major Honeywell rolled a wild eye at the
intently listening boys. Both shook their heads
emphatically. The Major turned again to the
telephone.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, sir, but our decision is not to
sell the <em>Flyer</em> at any price whatever.... No,
I am sure that we shall not change our minds
about it.... All right. To whom have I been
speaking, please?”</p>

<p>As the Major asked this final question, Ned
sprang to an adjacent extension of the telephone.
He caught the distant guttural rumble of a heavy
voice:</p>

<p>“My name, it is of no matter since you have
not the airship for sale. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>The words were spoken with a marked German
accent that in some way seemed peculiarly familiar
to Ned. He had heard that voice before,
and recently too. But where?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">GETTING THE “OCEAN FLYER” READY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The rest of that day was a very busy one for
the Airship Boys, even though Major Honeywell
himself lent as much assistance as he could.
There was a variety of miscellaneous supplies to
be purchased, hurried letters to be written to
Ned’s parents in Chicago and to Alan’s sister,
Mary. Both boys agreed that it was best not to
state the destination or object of their trip for
fear that their beloved ones might suffer all
sorts of anxieties until their safe return. So
they wrote briefly that they were going off upon
a little three or four days’ business trip in the
<em>Ocean Flyer</em> and that it was the urgency of the
business in hand that prevented their making
the farewell visit they desired.</p>

<p>Their shopping for necessary supplies did not
take the boys long, for they could estimate pretty
closely what they would need. On account of the
extremely high altitudes at which they would
fly it was necessary for them to buy especially
heavy underwear, felt boots, wool jackets, fleece-lined<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
fingered mittens and heavy caps for four
persons&mdash;as Alan said: “The fourth outfit
for Bob Russell, so that he won’t freeze coming
back with us.”</p>

<p>Then there were food supplies (the <em>Flyer</em> was
equipped with a regular cook’s galley) to be
bought, a dozen hair-trigger automatic revolvers,
half a dozen light-weight repeating rifles of the
latest pattern, cartridge belts, rounds of ammunition,
and a large American flag. Neither the
firearms nor the flag were to be used except in
case of absolute necessity.</p>

<p>Major Honeywell got the aeroplane works in
Newark, where the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> was being kept
in storage, on the telephone, and issued instructions
to the manager there to run the big
aircraft out of the hangar into the inclosed
experimental field ready for inspection, and to
lay in fresh supplies of the special grades of
gasoline and ether needed for power.</p>

<p>All incidental shopping completed, Major
Honeywell placed his big automobile at the disposal
of Ned and Alan, and the trip between
Greater New York and Newark was accomplished
at a rate that turned the speedometer needle
halfway around its circumference and raised
angry protests from every traffic policeman as<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
the car whizzed by. This was not, of course, a
wise thing to do, but the Major’s chauffeur was
an especially good driver and the boys felt justified
by the exceptional matter in hand.</p>

<p>An unusual stir was apparent inside the field
of the aeroplane works as the Major’s automobile
raced up to the high brick wall which insured
privacy for the grounds. At the far end of the
ground stretched the squatty brick buildings of
the factory, with a wireless station and various
other signaling devices on the parapeted roof.
Extending out from the yard front and ending
at the edge of the big experimental field, was the
“setting-up room,” a drop of heavy canvas
roofing, supported every hundred feet by rough,
unpainted posts. Under this tent-like structure
was to be seen almost every size and variety of
flying craft made in America, to say nothing of
several flying machines of obviously foreign
design. Most of these were covered by heavy
tarpaulins to protect them while not in use. A
whole corps of mechanicians was just then pushing
out into the aviation field another and very
different type of flyer, the heroic proportions of
which dwarfed all the other machines into
insignificance.</p>

<p>The eyes of the Airship Boys lighted up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>“There she goes!” they cried in unison.
“They are getting her all ready for us.”</p>

<p>They jumped out of the automobile and hurried
across the field to where the peerless wonder
of the world’s aircraft stood, a literal monument
to their inventive genius.</p>

<p>The <em>Ocean Flyer</em> has been too fully commented
upon and described in scientific journals, magazines
and newspapers from coast to coast to
require any very detailed account of it in this
story.</p>

<p>Overlapping, dull glinting plates of the recently-discovered
metal magnalium covered the entire
body of the vessel like the scales of a fish. The
planes and truss were likewise formed of this
substance, which is a magnesium alloy with copper
and standard vanadium, or chrome steel.
The extreme lightness of magnalium, combined
with a toughness found in no other metal or
alloy, made possible the perfection of this largest
of all airships.</p>

<p>The vessel was modeled after the general form
of a sea gull, with wings outspread in full flight,
its peculiarly ingenious construction insuring not
only the maximum of speed, but also that hitherto
elusive automatic stability of the planes which
for years past has been the despair of aeroplane<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
builders on both sides of the “big pond.”</p>

<p>Braces extending from the bottom of the car
body and metal cables from the top partly supported
the vast expanse of magnalium steel
sheets, but toward the outer ends, the wings,
or planes, extended unsupported in apparent
defiance of all mechanical laws. Three sets of
“tandem” planes projected with slight dihedral
angles for a distance decreasing from eighty, to
sixty, to forty feet, on each side of the ship
body, affording a wing-spread never before successfully
attained, and giving the whole the exact
resemblance of a gigantic metal bird.</p>

<p>Each of these planes was made of three distinct
telescoping fore and aft sections, with a
full spread of twenty-one feet. By means of
the immense pressure gauges almost concealed
under the curved front of the main plane, the
rear sections were drawn in by cables on a
spring drum until the width of each of the
three planes was reduced to seven feet. The
moment the air pressure was lessened by descent
or lessening of speed, the narrow wing surfaces
automatically spread. In rapid flight the reverse
pressure on the gauges allowed the spring drums
to reel in the extension surfaces, housing all
extensions securely, either beneath or over the<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
main section of the wings. In this way the
buoyancy of the airship remained always
the same.</p>

<p>The body of the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> consisted of two
decks or stories, with a pilot house, staterooms,
fuel chambers, engineroom, bridges above and
protective galleries. The completely enclosed
hull, pierced with heavy, glass-protected ports,
and doors, was twelve feet wide, thirteen feet
high and thirty feet long, ending in a maze of
metal trusswork at the rear, and a magnalium-braced
tail, seventy-three feet more in length,
exclusive of the twenty-foot rudder at the stern.</p>

<p>To drive this huge craft, a much higher percentage
of motor power than ever before secured
had to be transformed into propulsive energy.
The ordinary aeroplane propeller permits the
escape of much of the motive power, but the
<em>Ocean Flyer</em> was equipped with the new French
“moon” devices, which do away with the
“slip,” and allow the full power of the engine
to be applied to the greatest advantage. Viewed
sidewise, this new form of propeller looks
exactly like a crescent, its tips curving ahead of
its shaft attachment. The massive eleven-foot
propellers of the <em>Ocean Flyer</em>, with a section five
feet broad at the center, gave ample “push.”<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
They were located just forward of and beneath
the front edge of the long planes. Powerful
magnalium chain drives connected these with
the shaft inside the hull. Behind the chain
drives, a light metal runway extended twelve feet
from the car to the propeller bearings, so that
the latter might be reached while the car was
in transit, should adjustment or oiling be found
necessary.</p>

<p>Within the hull of the vessel, four feet from
the bottom, a shaft extended carrying a third
or auxiliary “moon” propeller, differing from
the exterior side propellers by being seven
instead of eleven feet in length. This reserve
propelling force was for use in case either of
the other propellers became disabled.</p>

<p>The motive force of the <em>Flyer</em> was secured by
a chemical engine, run by dehydrated sulphuric
ether and gasoline. Magnalium cylinders sustained
the shock of the tremendous “explosions”
as the cylinders revolved past the
exploding chamber and developed a power
previously undreamed of.</p>

<p>Each of the two huge engines used was six
feet in diameter, with four explosion chambers
cooled by fans which fed liquid ammonia to the
cylinder walls in a spray and then furnished<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
power for its re-liquefaction. In form, each
engine resembled a great wheel, or turbine, on
the rim of which appeared a series of conical
cylinder pockets. These, when presented to the
explosion chambers, received the impact of the
explosion, and then, running through an expanding
groove, allowed the charge to continue
expanding and applying power until the groove
terminated in an open slot which instantly
cleansed the cylinders of the burnt gases. By
this arrangement there was only a twentieth
part of the engine wheel where no power was
being simultaneously imparted, thus giving practically
a continuous torque.</p>

<p>Weighing over five hundred pounds each, and
with a velocity of one thousand five hundred
revolutions per minute, those big turbines generated
nine hundred and seventy-three horse
power, natural brake test, and this could be
raised to more than a thousand horse power
without danger. Revolving in opposite directions,
they eliminated all dangerous gyroscopic
action. As has been said, power was applied to
the propellers by special magnalium gearing.</p>

<p>The <em>Ocean Flyer</em> was equipped with the first
enclosed car or cabin ever used on an aeroplane.
The compartments of its two decks connected<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
with each other, but all could be made one air-tight
whole. Even the engines were within an
air-tight compartment. Attached to the bow of
the hull was a large metal funnel with a wide
flange. Tubes leading from the small end of this
passed into each room on the vessel. Flying at
sixty miles or more an hour caused the air to
rush into this funnel with such force as soon to
fill any or all of the compartments with compressed
air. At a speed of two hundred miles
per hour, this was likely to be so great that,
instead of having too little air, there would be
far too much were it not for regulating pressure
gauges which shut off the flow from time
to time. Thus the aeronauts were not only
assured plenty of breathing air even in the
highest altitudes, but the pressure gave sufficient
heat to prevent frost bite from the intense
cold which prevails beyond a certain height above
the earth’s surface.</p>

<p>A supply of oxygen was of course carried for
use in case of necessity, although the Airship
Boys had in the past proved that their funnel
device obviated all need of it.</p>

<p>The pilot room was located at the bow on the
second deck. In appearance it largely resembled
the wheel-house of the ordinary ocean liner. The<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
compass box, with its compensating magnetic
mechanism beneath, stood just in front of the
steering wheel, below and parallel with which,
but not connected with it, was a wheel for elevating
or depressing the planes. Both of these
wheels operated indirectly, utilizing compressed
air cylinders to move the big rudder and wing
surfaces. At the right of these wheels was the
engine control, consisting of a series of starting
and stopping levers for each engine and the
gear clutch for each wheel.</p>

<p>At the left, in compact, semicircular form, was
the signal-board, the automatic indicator recording
at all times the position of each plane, the
set of the rudder and the speed of the engines.
Below this was the chronometer and a speaking
tube which kept the pilot always in communication
with every other part of the vessel. Immediately
behind the pilot’s wheel was a seeming
confusion of indicators and gauges for the making
of observations. There was the aerometer,
the automatic barograph, the checking barometer,
the equilibrium statoscope, a self-recording
thermometer, the compressed air gauge for all
compartments, chart racks, indicators to show
the exact rate of consumption of fuel and lubricating
oil and so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[43]</span></p>

<p>As may be surmised, the duties of the pilot
were not merely to steer and keep a lookout
ahead, but also to watch the machine and counteract
the influence of unexpected air currents and
those atmospheric obstructions like “pockets,”
indistinguishable puffs of air, and the like, which
are always very dangerous and will jolt an airship
exactly as a rock or piece of wood will
bounce an automobile into the air and maybe
completely overturn it. Among experienced aeronauts,
these air-ruts are recognized as being one
of the chief perils in aviation.</p>

<p>Ned Napier and Alan Hope usually took turns
acting as pilot on a three-hour shift, any longer
interval of duty being too nerve-racking a strain.
The third man whom they usually took with
them on the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> was supposed to be
stationed in the engine room. It was his duty
to watch the automatic fuel and lubricator supply
feed pipes, the compressed air gauges and pipe
valves, the signal and illuminating light motor,
the oxygen tanks and the plane valves, in addition
to the wireless apparatus for communication
with the outside world.</p>

<p>On long flights one of the three aviators slept
while the others remained on duty. Thus one of
them was always kept fresh and alert to meet<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
the demands of any unforeseen emergency.</p>

<p>Ned, Alan and Major Honeywell made a careful
investigation of every detail of the <em>Ocean
Flyer</em>, satisfying themselves that it was in all
respects perfect for their hazardous trip. They
found everything to be absolutely shipshape, and
those additional supplies which had arrived,
were already being stowed away on board.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Alan, “everything seems to be
attended to properly, and there is no reason
why we can’t start any time we like. The
sooner the better, because there’s no telling what
they may be going to do to Bob over there in
Belgium any one of these days.”</p>

<p>“Right,” echoed Ned. “Let’s see. To-day
is Wednesday. What do you say to starting off
to-morrow morning early. Then we can arrive
in Muhlbruck not later than some time early
Friday morning. We will have darkness to
cover our arrival there.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” supplemented Major
Honeywell. “I don’t like to see you boys risking
this thing, but if it must be done you should
take every possible advantage. And now, if
you’re through inspecting the <em>Flyer</em>, what do
you say to riding back to New York with me in
the automobile and taking dinner at my house?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>“The major is a man after my own heart,”
cried Ned.</p>

<p>“My stomach cries out for him,” grinned
Alan, as they made their way back to the waiting
motor car.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">BUCK STEWART&mdash;AND A WARNING</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It was not a particularly jolly meal at Major
Honeywell’s that night. The major was
oppressed by grave fears of what might happen
to his young friends on their journey, and the
Airship Boys felt the seriousness of the step
they were about to take. However, youthful
spirits are buoyant, and the good-smelling, appetizing
dishes that were served them soon drove
away dull gloom and revived the boys’ spirits.
As Alan said:</p>

<p>“What’s the use of sitting here staring at
each other across the table as if we were at a
funeral? Nobody is going to die or even get
hurt. It’s no use trying to be melancholy on a
full stomach, and I, for one, am going to laugh
right now.”</p>

<p>The dessert course was just being served
when there came a ring at the doorbell, and a
few minutes later the maid announced that a
reporter from the <cite>Herald</cite> wanted to see either
Mr. Napier or Mr. Hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[47]</span></p>

<p>“Show the gentleman right in here,” said
Major Honeywell, after the boys had agreed
to see him.</p>

<p>The young man who came in was slightly
larger and older than either Ned or Alan. He
was tall, wiry, and had the cool, assured bearing
of one who has survived many rebuffs and still
got what he wanted. As he entered the dining
room door, both Ned and Alan sprang to their
feet and rushed impulsively to meet him.</p>

<p>“Buck Stewart!” they shouted joyously,
pumping his arms up and down. “Well, if this
isn’t both the most unexpected and the luckiest
thing! We’ve been wanting to have a talk with
you for two days past, and meant to ask the
managing editor about you Tuesday, only we
were interrupted and got so flustered over it
that we left before remembering that you were
one of the main reasons for our call.”</p>

<p>“What good fairy brought you here to-night,
Buck?” asked Ned, pulling the newcomer down
into a chair at the table and shoving a piece of
pie in front of him.</p>

<p>“I’d rather eat that pie than talk right now,
but I suppose I’ve got to answer your question
first,” said Buck. “We reporters always are
in hard lines. You ask how I happen to be<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
here? Well, it was this way: The night city
editor called me over about an hour ago and
gave me an assignment on you two chaps.”</p>

<p>“Why, what news is there about us that the
<cite>Herald</cite> could use?” asked Ned, exchanging a
rapid glance with Alan and the major.</p>

<p>Buck removed a longing eye from the piece
of pie to reply:</p>

<p>“We learned in some way that unknown
parties had made you a cash offer of something
like three hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars
for the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> and that you turned
them down cold. Is that true? Also, who were
the people who wanted to buy the <em>Flyer</em> at
such an astounding cash figure, and for what
purpose did they want it? If you’ll give me
full details I’ll be much obliged.” This as the
reporter pulled a folded bundle of note paper
and a pencil from his pocket. “These prospective
buyers didn’t represent any one of the warring
nations in Europe, did they?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what we don’t know and what
we feared,” said Alan. “I’m afraid that we
can’t give you much dope for a story, though,
Buck, because we know as little about them as
you do.”</p>

<p>Then he went on to tell about Mr. Phillips,<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
the go-between’s mysterious call, and the telephone
conversation with the man with a strong
German accent.</p>

<p>“I’m sure that I’ve heard his voice somewhere
before and that not so very long ago, too,”
added Ned. “I’ve racked my brains ever since
trying to place him.”</p>

<p>“Huh, sounds funny,” commented the reporter
musingly, “but you certainly haven’t given me
much of a lead for the ‘story’ I was after.
Well, I’ll be going and not interrupt your little
party here any further.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Buck,” said Ned. “We
haven’t told you yet why we wanted to see
the <cite>Herald’s</cite> managing editor about you.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Buck, sitting down more
comfortably in his chair. “Now if one of you
gentlemen will hand me a fork, I’ll dispose of
this mince pie while you’re spinning the yarn.”</p>

<p>So, while the reporter was busy making the
pie disappear, Ned told him of Bob Russell’s
predicament in Belgium and what they proposed
to do towards a rescue.</p>

<p>“We want you to go with us, Buck,” said
he, “just as you did the time we made the
‘twelve-hour’ London-to-New York flight two
years ago with the coronation pictures for the<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
<cite>Herald</cite>. The managing editor will surely let you
go for the two or three days needful when you
ask him, especially as it will enable the paper
to get a representative right at the front, with
no bull-headed censor to edit his ‘copy.’”</p>

<p>“If the boss won’t let me off, I’ll throw up
the job anyway,” shouted Buck, jumping up in
great excitement. “Why, Bob Russell and I
are old friends, just as you are, and I don’t
want to leave him in the lurch any more than
you do. It’s mighty good of you to give me
this chance to make one of the rescue party.
Count on Buck Stewart, boys&mdash;hair, tooth and
nail!”</p>

<p>The reporter’s enthusiasm was contagious.
All three sprang to their feet, and, with exclamations
of mutual pleasure, were shaking hands to
seal the compact when&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ting-a-ling-ling! Ting-a-ling-ling!” went
the telephone bell.</p>

<p>“Ned,” called the major, who answered the
call, “it’s somebody that wants to speak with
you personally&mdash;<em>a man with a marked German
accent</em>.”</p>

<p>The little company around the dining table
stared curiously at each other as Ned Napier
took up the receiver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[51]</span></p>

<p>“Hello! This is Mr. Napier.... Yes, I’m
one of the owners of the <em>Ocean Flyer</em>. Who is
this speaking and what do you want?”</p>

<p>The voice at the other end of the line was
harsh and guttural. The words were spoken in
a truly menacing tone:</p>

<p>“You do not need to know who I am. It is
sufficient that I warn you. We who are banded
together in this country know this thing that
you think of doing. We know that you intend
a trip in your flying ship to the war zone. Take
our advice and do not attempt it. You are being
closely watched and we will not hold ourselves
responsible for what may happen if you try to
carry out your plan. You are young and life is
dear to you. Beware!”</p>

<p>The telephone clicked abruptly at the other
end of the line and the threatening voice was
still. Ned sat as if petrified, his face a
study of mingled amazement, indecision and
indignation.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Ned? Who was it? Was
it that same person who called up about the
<em>Flyer</em>?” cried the others crowding around him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Ned, “it was the same voice
and I am sure that I have heard it before.”</p>

<p>Then he went on to tell them of the ominous<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
threats of the mysterious stranger. A chorus
of exclamations followed his recital.</p>

<p>“The blackguard!” ejaculated Major Honeywell.
“We ought to set detectives on his trail.”</p>

<p>“Small chance of ever catching him that way
with the meagre clues we have,” said reporter
Buck. “Besides, we haven’t time to monkey
with anything like that,&mdash;unless, of course, you
boys decide that it is better not to risk the
enmity of these unknowns. They evidently mean
business.”</p>

<p>Ned’s lips had fixed themselves into a grim,
straight line, and Alan’s frown was no less
determined.</p>

<p>“All he hopes to do is to frighten us into
selling the airship to him,” said Alan, “and I
don’t believe that his big threats were anything
but sheer bluff. Why, they wouldn’t dare attack
us right here in the heart of civilized New York.”</p>

<p>“Whoever they are, or whatever they may
try to do, we’re not going to let a phone call
scare us out of this effort to save Bob Russell,”
said Ned. “We’re all ready to start now except
for getting the <cite>Herald’s</cite> permission to let Buck
here go with us. He can see the managing editor
about that the first thing in the morning, and
then we’ll be off immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[53]</span></p>

<p>“But if this gang really has you boys spied
upon, they will certainly make some attempt to
stop you,” argued Major Honeywell.</p>

<p>“Nobody stands any chance of stopping us
once we get up in the air,” answered Ned, “but,
as you say, we may as well try to make our get-away
as secretly as possible. I would suggest
that instead of starting out by daylight to-morrow,
as we planned, that we wait until midnight.
Each of us can leave his house at a different
time during the day and go about as if we have
changed our minds and called the trip off. Then,
just in time to reach the Newark factory, each
one can start off alone. We should be able to
disarm any suspicion in that way.”</p>

<p>Everybody approved heartily of Ned’s scheme
and parted that night with a little more earnestness
in their handshakes than usual. All of the
road back home the Airship Boys cast furtive
glances over their shoulders every now and then,
but no sign of any followers was visible.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">ESCAPING FROM DEADLY SHADOWS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Alan Hope spent most of the next day at the
offices of the Universal Transportation Company,
and was inclined to scoff at the idea of his being
watched. Nevertheless he had a loaded automatic
revolver tucked away in his hip pocket,
and, as night drew on, his assurance began to
ooze gradually, and he felt more than once to
make sure that his weapon was still there ready
for defense.</p>

<p>Ned Napier was really impressed with the
threats of the mysterious German, and, though
he did not arm himself as Alan had, he kept a
sharp lookout for suspicious characters about
him. All day long he wandered with an air of
affected carelessness through the downtown shopping
district, made a couple of short business
calls, ate leisurely at the Ritz, and seemed to
have no thought of anything but home and bed
for that evening.</p>

<p>Buck Stewart arose early that morning, ate
a hearty breakfast, and when he started out took<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
with him what was apparently an ordinary cane,
but which really was a rod of steel, encased in
leather. Many reporters carry them when they
are sent out on assignments into dangerous sections
of the city.</p>

<p>Swinging his stick jauntily, he made his way
first to the offices of the <cite>Herald</cite>, where a brief
chat with the managing editor readily procured
him permission to accompany the Airship Boys
on their trip. The editor, in fact, made a regular
assignment of it and cautioned Buck to take
along with him plenty of pencils, notebooks and
a small camera that could be swung over one
shoulder with a strap.</p>

<p>Thus burdened, Buck again sought the street.
Leaving “Newspaper Row” behind, he sauntered
along, stopping now and then to look at articles
in the shop windows, and finally decided to see
the matinee at the <em>Casino</em>.</p>

<p>Broadway was thronged with the usual afternoon
crowd of beautiful women and fashionably
dressed idlers for which it is famous. The
reporter shouldered his way through these, a
little self-conscious of the bumping camera-box
over his shoulder and the way his pockets bulged
with surplus notebooks. Once a tall, plainly
dressed man with a close-cropped beard bumped<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
into him. There was a mutual exchange of
apologies and the crowd soon swallowed him.
Later on Buck met a fellow newspaperman in
front of the Astor and stopped to chat with him.
An inadvertent side glance during this conversation
discovered the same bearded stranger standing
just to one side of the hotel entrance, as if
hesitating whether to go in or not. There was
no recognition in his cold eyes as Buck’s glance
caught his, but the reporter’s heart gave a little
jump.</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” growled Buck to himself, “I’m
getting to be a regular old granny! Here I see
the same passer-by twice in an afternoon on
Broadway and am afraid that he’s a spy waiting
to sandbag me.”</p>

<p>His uneasiness was not thus to be laughed
off though, and spoiled his enjoyment of the performance
at the theatre. He scanned the audience
around him narrowly to see if the bearded
man was among them, and was relieved at failing
to find him.</p>

<p>After the show Buck again wandered aimlessly
through the streets. He was keenly on the alert
for spies, and found merely killing time to be
harder than he had thought it would be. The
strain was beginning to tell on his nerves. At<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
dusk a million lights flashed out in a dazzling
array of figures and designs and the Great
White Way made good its name. But Buck was
tired of it by then. He strolled over to near-by
Fifth Avenue, where there were fewer people
to jostle him and the rattle of the streets was
less distracting. He felt, for no apparent reason,
increasingly sure that he was being followed.</p>

<p>To make sure of his suspicions Buck walked
at times very slowly; at others rapidly; but he
observed no suspicious “shadows.” True, there
were a number of people walking behind him, but
his inspection revealed nothing sinister about
them.</p>

<p>Buck told himself that his fears were silly&mdash;that
he was as bad as a girl in the dark. Still
the vague dread oppressed him.</p>

<p>He ate in a small restaurant just off Fourth
Avenue, entering the place at the same time as
two other men whose dress indicated them to be
shop clerks, or something of the kind. When
he arose to pay his bill and leave, they did also.
At the counter, one of them brushed as if accidentally
against him, and Buck felt deft fingers
pass swiftly over his pockets as if searching
for something. Was the fellow feeling to see if
Buck carried a revolver?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[58]</span></p>

<p>The reporter wondered, but said nothing to the
strangers. Their faces were innocent enough
and their eyes met his questioning glance candidly.
Buck went on out into the night and
they followed close on his heels. As he stood
quietly in the doorway there, however, the men
bade each other good night and parted&mdash;going
in opposite directions along the street. Finally
they disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>Buck was sorely perplexed. He felt absolutely
certain that it was unsafe for him to be wandering
about alone, yet it was several hours too
early to start for Newark. Finally he decided
to take in several moving picture shows as the
safest way to keep out of danger. One of the
men whom he had seen in the little restaurant
was lounging outside of the first playhouse
Buck visited. Before the films were fully run
the reporter slipped out through one of the side
exits into an alley.</p>

<p>It was so dark there that he hardly could see
the ground under foot. Twenty assailants might
be waiting in the gloom for aught he could tell.
The reporter was not ashamed to take frankly to
his heels and rush out onto the lighted street as
fast as he could. He noticed that the lounger
had disappeared from the theatre doorway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[59]</span></p>

<p>Hoping now that he had thrown his unknown
pursuers off the trail, Buck visited a second
moving picture playhouse. There a drunken man
plumped roughly down into the vacant seat next
to him and tried to pick a quarrel without any
excuse at all. The reporter would have taken
this as rather a joke had it not been that there
was no vile odor of intoxicants on this drunkard’s
breath. Shoving the rough to one side,
Buck hurried out of the theatre, walked quickly
down the street to the next corner; crossed there
to see if he was followed; turned the next corner;
walked two blocks along an ill-lighted
deserted side street and there jumped into a
dark doorway to listen.</p>

<p>Yes! there was no mistake about it! He could
hear the patter of running feet less than a quarter
of a block behind. Ere Buck had time to
flee, rubber heels on the pursuers’ shoes deadened
their footfalls again and two shadowy
figures appeared directly in front of his hiding
place. They paused there, breathing hard, and
holding a hasty conference.</p>

<p>“How ever did he get away from you, Hermann?”
snarled the bigger of the two men to
the other, whom Buck now recognized as the
“drunken man” of the theatre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>“Why talk about that now that he has again
eluded us?” he growled. “If only we had him
here on this dark street, we could soon finish
with him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we must catch him at once. He must
still be in the neighborhood and isn’t armed. I
made sure of that in the restaurant a couple of
hours ago. But anyway, he can’t go far without
Otto, Wilhelm or some of the others seeing him.
They are covering all of these three streets, you
know.”</p>

<p>The man addressed as Hermann grunted his
assent.</p>

<p>“I’m winded from that run after the fool,”
said he. “Let’s sit down in this doorway and
rest for a few moments.”</p>

<p>Buck’s heart began to beat faster. He
knew that his discovery and assault were only
a matter of a few seconds. The scoundrelly pair
had now approached within arm’s reach of him,
so without further delay the reporter swung
aloft his loaded cane and brought it down in a
smashing side blow on the head of the nearest
man.</p>

<div id="Ref_60" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i063.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><em>A Narrow Escape.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>A bellow of rage and pain shocked the neighborhood
into wakefulness. As the second man
leaped savagely at him, Buck evaded a wicked<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
knife stab and struck him full between the eyes
with his clenched fist. The fellow reeled, jerked
a pistol from his pocket and emptied it blindly
at the place where his combatant had stood an
instant before.</p>

<p>But Buck was bounding down the street as
fast as his legs could carry him, his camera
bumping clumsily against his back. A cross-town
trolley car was clanging the bell down the
next street and the breathless reporter made a
running jump to catch it. Just as he did so a
third man with a closely-cropped beard sprang
after him from the curb. He caught the camera
and gave a mighty tug at it which broke the
strap, and, with the box in his hands, sent him
sprawling backwards in the street. The rushing
trolley car did not stop, and Buck’s extraordinary
agility was all that enabled him to swing
aboard safely.</p>

<p>“It’s a fine night, mister,” said the conductor,
as he rang up the fare.</p>

<p>Buck answered him with the sourest of stares.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">WHAT HAPPENED TO NED</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Alan Hope reached the Newark factory of the
Universal Transportation Company shortly
before eleven o’clock that night, after an uneventful
trip out via the suburban railroad service.
He found the big plant gloomy and silent, without
a light to show that activity was really going
on within. In response to a prearranged code
of rings on the bell at the great main gates,
he was admitted.</p>

<p>The <em>Ocean Flyer</em> had been wheeled to the
extreme end of the big aviation field where she
might have plenty of room for her initial rise
into the air, and the factory foreman informed
Alan that all was now ready for departure at
any minute.</p>

<p>Ned Napier arrived within ten minutes after
his chum. Although he had sustained no actual
mishap on the way out, it was by sheer luck only
that he escaped the trap which had been laid for
him. He had attended the performance at the
Winter Garden, purposely leaving early. In<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
the foyer as he went out a stranger in full evening
dress (apparently one of the spectators
finishing his between-acts cigarette) accosted
him with extreme politeness:</p>

<p>“Dear gentleman, your pardon,” said he,
“but are you not Mr. Edward Napier, the
aeronaut?”</p>

<p>“No,” Ned answered him coldly. “My name
is Lloyd Jenkins. I am a traveling shoe
salesman.”</p>

<p>“My mistake, then,” laughed the stranger
lightly. “Just to show that there’s no hard
feelings, won’t you join me in a little drink
down at the bar?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” the boy answered, “I
never use intoxicating liquors,” and then, being
already suspicious, brushed on past the stranger
and out into the street.</p>

<p>The usual line of taxicabs lined the whole
curb on both sides of Broadway for a block or
more. As soon as Ned appeared there was a
hoarse-voiced chorus of shouts:</p>

<p>“Taxi! Taxicab, sir? This way, sir!
Taxicab?”</p>

<p>Several of the chauffeurs crowded around Ned,
trying to persuade him to patronize them rather
than their fellows. One driver, muffled deep in<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
a fur-collared overcoat, even went so far as to
lay his hand on the boy’s arm.</p>

<p>“I have a big, comfortable limousine car
here,” he said. “Same price as those stuffy
little taxis.”</p>

<p>Out of the corner of his eye Ned just then
saw the persistent stranger of the theatre lobby
coming out of the entrance towards him, and,
not being anxious for any further acquaintance,
the boy turned hastily to the chauffeur, saying:</p>

<p>“All right! Your limousine for me!”</p>

<p>“Where to, sir?”</p>

<p>Ned was properly cautious.</p>

<p>“The Grand Central Station,” he answered,
intending then to change to another taxicab
which could double on his tracks and take him
on to the rendezvous in Newark.</p>

<p>The gentleman in evening clothes was hurrying
towards Ned, signaling wildly for him to
wait.</p>

<p>“Drive ahead!” called the boy to his chauffeur,
and plunged into the black, cushioned
depths of the big limousine. Ned kept right on
going through, however, tore open the door on the
opposite side, and was plunged headlong to the
pavement by the sudden rush of the machine as
it fairly leaped into high speed. There in the<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
gloom of the car he had vaguely observed the
uneasy stir of a man hidden beneath the heaped-up
rugs in the corner.</p>

<p>The boy raced across the street, dodging
whizzing motors and heedless of angrily-honking
horns, sprang inside the nearest taxicab and
yelled to the driver:</p>

<p>“Give her all the juice you can! Five dollars
extra if you can get me to Brooklyn Bridge
within twenty-five minutes!”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my darnedest,” the chauffeur, a grizzled
man of fifty, assured him.</p>

<p>They were off in a jiffy, amid a grating of
gear-shifts and thunderous explosions of the
opened exhaust. The motor began to whine as
the gas was fed more and more rapidly; the
white glare of Broadway slipped past the cab
windows in a dull blur. Traffic policemen’s
whistles were merely unheeded incidentals of
the mad race.</p>

<p>Peering back through the little window in the
rear of the machine, Ned saw at least two other
automobiles join in the pursuit from the front
of the theatre. The big limousine was one of
them. The stranger in evening clothes and
another man were craning their necks out of the
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[66]</span></p>

<p>“Turn over onto Fifth Avenue and double
up and down some of the side streets as fast
as you can,” called Ned through the speaking
tube to his chauffeur. “Never mind about
Brooklyn Bridge. There are two machines
behind that I want to shake off our trail.”</p>

<p>“All right, boss,” replied the chauffeur.
“You just leave it to Barney O’Dorgan to lose
any other chasing taxi in this old town.”</p>

<p>From then on it became a game of hide-and-go-seek.
Finally away over on the East Side,
it looked as if the pursuers had been shaken off.
No sign of them had been apparent for at least
half an hour, and Ned was just congratulating
himself, when the car turned a corner, and right
there, at a standstill under the arc-light, in the
center of the otherwise deserted street, stood
the big limousine, with the three men arguing
violently beside it.</p>

<p>Chauffeur Barney O’Dorgan caught sight of it
as soon as Ned did. Simultaneously the trio
recognized their lost quarry and started towards
it at a run. There was neither time nor space
for Barney O’Dorgan to turn his car about, so,
as cool as you please, he simply threw his gear
lever as far as it would go, flooded the cylinders
with gas, and the taxicab began to race backwards<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
at as furious a pace as it had previously
gone forward.</p>

<p>Seeing their prey escaping, all three of the
pursuers jerked revolvers from their coats and
opened fire. Two bullets shattered the windshield
in front of intrepid Barney’s face;
another tore its vicious way through the wooden
body of the cab and imbedded itself with a dull
thud in the back wall not a foot from Ned’s
head. All of the other shots went wild. Two
blocks down this side street and the cursing
pursuers were left more than half of that
distance behind. Then chauffeur Barney
reversed his gears, turned the machine about,
and sped on his way, with Ned exulting behind
him.</p>

<p>“Barney, you’re a peach, and you won’t ever
regret the way you’ve stuck by me to-night,”
Ned called gratefully.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” the Irishman made
answer. “I knew by your looks that you
weren’t a crook, and certainly I wouldn’t let
that gang of high-binders nab you. Where to
now, sir?”</p>

<p>The driver certainly had proved himself
trustworthy, so Ned decided to tell him his true
destination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[68]</span></p>

<p>“Have you gasoline enough left to drive me
to the plant of the Universal Transportation
Company in Newark?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Plenty of gas,” grinned Barney, “but I’m
not so sure about the air in my tires. Wait until
I look at them.”</p>

<p>The tires proved hard and sound, however.
Once more Barney took the wheel, and from
there on the ride to the rendezvous was uneventful.
Ned presented the chauffeur with thirty
dollars as a reward for his fidelity.</p>

<p>“That was a mighty close shave of yours,
Ned,” said Alan, after he had heard the story,
“but where can Buck Stewart be? It’s already
past the time we agreed upon. Do you suppose
they could have caught him?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, my boys,” cried a hearty voice
behind them, and there stood the reporter, his
clothes rumpled, his hat dented out of shape
and with pockets a-bulge with notebooks.
“There are only two parts of me missing&mdash;my
camera and cane, and I had to leave them in
other hands without stopping to argue about
it.”</p>

<p>Then Buck told the story of his thrilling night’s
experiences and mutual congratulations followed.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess that we’ve given them all the<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
slip at last,” said Alan, “and since it’s away
past the hour we fixed for starting, let’s take
our places aboard the <em>Flyer</em> and be off. We
haven’t any too much time to lose, you know.”</p>

<p>“Right-o!” echoed Buck and Ned.</p>

<p>So the trio made their way to where the huge
airship stood ready. They swung up the ladder
into the main port. Ned took his position in
the pilot room; Buck in the engine room. Alan
made a hasty survey of the vessel, poking
around here and there with a powerful hand-searchlight
to see that all was as it should be.
Their hearts beat high with excitement, which
likewise agitated the little group of factory
mechanics who had gathered to see them off.
Just as Ned was about to signal Bob for their
start, there came a tremendous battering upon
the great barred doors of the factory.</p>

<p>“Open and admit us!” roared an authoritative,
bull-like voice. “Let no man leave here
before we enter&mdash;in the name of the United
States of America!”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">SIX MILES UP IN THE AIR</span></h2>
</div>


<p>For an instant the hearts of all the boys stood
still and each looked at the other in
consternation.</p>

<p>“In the name of the United States of
America!”</p>

<p>That meant that in some inexplicable way
their project had leaked out and that the federal
government had sent officers to prevent their
going.</p>

<p>The heavy pounding on the great gate had
resumed and now the same commanding voice
shouted:</p>

<p>“Are you going to open to us, or is this
intended as resistance of the law? I give you
two minutes to open these doors before we smash
them in!”</p>

<p>“That fellow means business,” whispered
Alan. “Whatever can we do? We dare not
oppose them, yet to let them in means the
indefinite postponement of our flight.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go anyway,” said Ned, his eyes lighting
with determination. “This is only another<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
scheme to delay us. Are you all ready there,
Mr. Engineer?”</p>

<p>“Whenever you say the word,” answered
Bob up through the tube.</p>

<p>“Then start your engines! We’ll be a mile
up in the sky before they can break in those
heavy doors.”</p>

<p>So saying, Ned jammed down hard on his
starting lever, the whir of the big turbines
swelled forth. But not a tremor shook the <em>Ocean
Flyer</em>. It did not budge an inch.</p>

<p>Someone had been tampering with the pilot
room apparatus.</p>

<p>With a groan of desperation, Ned bent over
the complexity of gears. He located the trouble
almost immediately and was relieved to note that
it was merely superficial&mdash;a matter of minutes
to repair. But too late! At that moment the
big yard gates were burst open forcibly and in
strode four burly federal plain-clothes men,
displaying their badges of authority. One other
man accompanied them. Alan, who went out on
the lowest exposed gangway of the <em>Flyer</em> to
meet them, recognized him in an instant. It
was Mr. Geisthorn, the local correspondent of
the <cite>Berliner Tageblatt</cite>.</p>

<p>“Is this Mr. Napier?” growled the leader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[72]</span></p>

<p>“No, I am Mr. Hope. Mr. Napier will be
here presently.”</p>

<p>The officer pulled an official looking document
from his breast pocket and extended it towards
Alan.</p>

<p>“We have a warrant for the arrest of both
of you gentlemen. Also for that of one Stewart,
said to be connected with the New York <cite>Herald</cite>.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Stewart will also be here presently,”
said Alan. “Upon what charge are we to be
detained?”</p>

<p>“Conspiracy&mdash;attempting to violate the
federal neutrality by lending aid to one or
another of the warring nations in Europe.”</p>

<p>“That is untrue.”</p>

<p>“I have nothing at all to do with that. My
instructions are simply to place a man on guard
over this vessel and to escort you gentlemen to
the secretary of state at Washington.”</p>

<p>Alan’s wits were working fast. He was fighting
to gain time, and the taffrail beneath his
fingers was aquiver with subtle tremors; he could
feel the premonitory hum of the engines as first
one and then the other of the big turbines began
moving. Ned had fixed the damage and things
were going down in the engine room. The hum
became a whir, a buzz and steady purr. The<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
<em>Ocean Flyer</em> trembled momentarily from stem
to stern. The eleven-foot “moon” propellers
began to whirl with rapidly increasing velocity.
Then suddenly the streams of compressed air
began to sing in a way that was like the terrifying
moan of a cyclone near at hand. Then the
tornado burst. Driven irresistibly forward by
the most powerful propellers ever devised by
man, that vast mass of steel surrendered and
slid jolting forward for twenty yards or so,
scattering the spectators wildly. With a bound
the huge craft rose into the still air and plunged
forward and upward on a forty-five degree angle
at rapidly increasing speed.</p>

<p>“Stop, in the name of&mdash;” The official’s
thunderous voice was lost in the distance. The
factory buildings and the little group of
detectives seemed to be dropping farther and
farther down below, and, were it not for the
rush of the wind, the <em>Flyer</em> might have seemed
to be stationary. The figures on the aviation
field already were dwarfed by distance and half
obliterated in the darkness. A sudden flash of
red light stabbed the shades far beneath, and
the report of the officer’s revolver was faintly
audible.</p>

<p>Already the airship was sailing out over<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
Greater New York. The lighted streets far below
checked the area into rectangular figures like a
gigantic chessboard. Broadway became a hazy
blur of white, and the atmosphere took on a
different quality&mdash;biting, hardy, more rarified.
The stars which sparkled coldly down there on
earth, became blazing, golden jewels in a setting
of black velvet, which was the sky. The noise of
the engines was now a low, steady drone.</p>

<p>The trip to Europe and the great war had
begun.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is nothing in particular to tell about
the three-thousand mile air voyage across the
Atlantic. To Alan, Ned and Buck, snugly
encased within the automatically heated interior
of the <em>Ocean Flyer</em>, the sense of aloofness from
solid earth was lost, and it seemed much as if
they were seated at their office desks back on
Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>The height of six miles from earth level at
which they traveled, blotted out all sight of
tangible objects, the comparative distance from
which might have made the altitude terrifying to
less experienced aviators than the Airship Boys.
Sometimes the <em>Flyer</em> cut its way through clouds,
but the main strata of these even lay far below<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
them. All that was visible through the heavily
glassed portholes was a dull, grayish void. The
terrific rate of speed at which they were traveling
was not at all apparent.</p>

<p>The young aeronauts were kept too busy
managing the ship to have spent much time star-gazing
if there had been something of outside
interest. Ned and Alan took turns in steering
the course and taking hourly observations upon
one or another of the exceedingly delicate instruments
at their command. Buck stood to the
engines in the hold, being relieved by one of
the other boys when it came his turn to sleep or
prepare meals.</p>

<p>Speaking of eating; those little repasts that
Buck Stewart prepared in the cook’s galley
were absolutely mouth-watering. Had he not
been so able a newspaper reporter, he would
have made a better chef. Oh! those luscious,
thick, juicy steaks, oozing such odoriferous steam
and a-swim in milk gravy from the same pan;
hashed, golden-brown potatoes, one mouthful of
which was to implant an insatiable craving for
more; little green pickles with a real tang to
them and flavored by the cinnamon, nutmeg and
tasty spices in which they were bottled; flap-jacks,
rich with molasses; sugar cakes and rich<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
coffee that warmed one down to the very toe
tips; and <em>fruits</em>! Well, there were big, rosy-cheeked
apples, that kind of oranges which can
be smelled all over the room, nuts, raisins and
what not. The larder was well stocked, and
Buck Stewart certainly knew how to prepare it
appetizingly if ever anyone did.</p>

<p>Fortunately the weather continued fair and no
dangerous air-pockets or unexpected whirlpool
wind currents were met with. The eighteenth
hour of their flight found everything going as
well as possibly could be wished. Their watches
were still set to New York time; it was now six
P. M. in America, but midnight in London.
There was a full moon, and it was quite light.</p>

<p>“By this time,” observed Ned, “we ought to
be pretty near the English coast, so I would
suggest that we drop the <em>Flyer</em> down to an altitude
where we can locate ourselves more
definitely by actual landmarks.”</p>

<p>This was done. With the huge wing-like
planes expanded to the full, the <em>Ocean Flyer</em>
coasted aslant the air-waves. The cloud belt
encircling the globe was penetrated and passed
through, leaving small drops of moisture glistening
all over the glass of the portholes. The
moon’s rays made the metal body of the vessel<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
glitter like so much silver. As they dropped
lower and lower, the world became dimly visible,
seeming to be literally rising to meet the descending
aviators. At an altitude of three thousand
feet, the downward planing was discontinued
and level flight again maintained.</p>

<p>To the one hand stretched the seemingly endless
expanse of gray, breaker-crested ocean, but
on the other, due ahead, lay the rock-bound,
irregular coast of the British Isles. Not so very
far away now, was poor Bob Russell on trial for
his life.</p>

<p>All three boys were thinking about him. It
was not necessary to mention his name.</p>

<p>“Not long now,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“No, not long,” agreed Alan and Buck.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">PARIS PROVES UNFRIENDLY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The course of the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> was altered
slightly so as to avoid passing over England and
risking pot-shots from a people who were already
in a semi-hysteria over the threatened invasion
by German Zeppelins. The next land they saw
was the coast of northern France. They followed
the Norman coast for a short distance and then
once more headed inland.</p>

<p>The flying speed had been reduced to thirty
miles per hour, when the airship first sank to
a three thousand foot level, and, traveling thus
slowly, the boys had a pretty good chance to
observe the country beneath them through their
powerful binoculars.</p>

<p>Normandy, the district where the Airship
Boys first began flying over France, had not yet
been touched by hostile invasion, and, save for
the absence of the usual fleets of fishing smacks
along the coast, was to all appearances the same
quaint, sleepy region as ever. Farther inland,
however, the ravages the war had made were<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
more plainly visible. Few trains could be seen,
and in many cases railway bridges or the tracks
themselves had been torn up. Fields lay, for
the most part, untilled; smoke no longer belched
from the long, finger-like chimneys of busy
factories. Nantes, Angiers, Le Mans and
Chartres, all huge cities over which the <em>Flyer</em>
passed, showed little activity save that even at
this early hour crowds were congregated in the
principal squares and in front of the government
offices where daily returns from the battle front
were posted.</p>

<p>The appearance of the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> was
invariably the cause of intense excitement.
People scurried frantically about, church bells
rang the alarm and soldiers ran to their posts
on the fortifications. Observed from the boys’
elevated position, the scene greatly resembled an
ant-hill disturbed with a stick.</p>

<p>The city of Chartres was only a comparatively
short flight, even at their reduced speed, for
the boys from Paris, the capital of France.
Twenty minutes after passing over the former
city, the Eiffel Tower, tallest structure in Paris,
appeared, and soon other world-famous landmarks
were easily discernible through the
glasses. There arose the imposing, ages-old<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
towers of the Notre Dame Cathedral, set on an
island in the middle of the river Seine, which,
under its many handsome bridges, wound like
a silver ribbon through the gray expanse of
buildings which go to make up the fourth largest
city in the world. There lay the Palais Royal,
with its celebrated shops and restaurants; there
the Louvre, Luxembourg and the Tuileries,
stored with priceless art treasures and famous
in history as the palaces of great kings. There
was the green shrubbery of the public parks and
the white, ribbon-like lines which marked the
Bois and the Champs Elysees, those famous
boulevards and promenades of fashion, radiating
from the Tuileries like the points of an immense
star.</p>

<p>But what a vast change from the gay, teeming
metropolis of less than a year previous. The
streets were nearly deserted, the pleasure seekers
were fled before the hot, scathing blast of
war, like chaff in a strong wind; the tables
before the gay little cafes lining the boulevards
were turned bottom-side up and dusty with long
disuse. There was no roar of traffic, no shrill
cries, no rumblings of passenger-filled omnibuses.
The Avenue de l’Opera was as quiet and
deserted as a village street. Automobiles had<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
disappeared; only here and there meandered
ancient cabs driven by doddering grandfathers
and drawn by skeleton horses with sprung knees.
A mournful, oppressive silence brooded over the
lightest-hearted city in the world.</p>

<p>The grass in the Tuileries gardens was unkept
and stood ankle high. The wooded shades of the
Bois de Boulogne had been turned into a great
pasture for herds of cattle, goats and sheep, to
provide food in case the Germans again succeeded
in actually besieging the city. Palaces
and celebrated public buildings were converted
into hospitals. The young men were all at the
front fighting; only the aged and wounded
remained in Paris.</p>

<p>The city had not yet recovered from its fright
of four months previous when the conquering
regiments of the Kaiser trampled Belgium
underfoot and advanced almost within cannon
range of the walls. Even then the battle was
raging and bayonet charges were daily occurrences
in the trenches less than an hour’s automobile
drive to the northeast.</p>

<p>Lookouts were stationed on all of the higher
buildings to give warning of the approach of
bomb-dropping German aviators in their wide,
white, flat-winged “Taube” aeroplanes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>

<p>The coming of the huge, shining <em>Ocean Flyer</em>
was seen while it was yet a considerable distance
from the city and a whole flock of French military
aeroplanes arose birdlike into the sky to
meet it. They resembled hornets defending their
nest. As the big airship planed down towards
them with its seventy-two feet of planes, extended
like wings on each side, the flock of smaller
French aircraft shot suddenly apart in different
directions, realizing their helplessness to combat
this new threatening monster of the air. Some
planed down like arrows into the city again
seeking safety. Others began to sweep in wide
circles around the <em>Ocean Flyer</em>, not daring to
approach nearer. The harsh roar of their motors
and propellers could be heard even within the
pilot house where Ned stood guiding the <em>Flyer’s</em>
course.</p>

<p>Then the alarmed Parisians unlimbered their
much-talked-of aerial cannon on this new menace
from the clouds. As each ugly black nozzle was
tilted skywards, there came a puff of greenish
smoke, flame spat forth and a huge shell was
hurled straight at the approaching airship.
Most of these terrible missiles fell far short of
their mark, but the gunners of a battery stationed
in the top of the Eiffel Tower were quick<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
in getting a better range and made it very
dangerous for the Airship Boys to continue their
descent.</p>

<p>“Holy smoke!” gasped Alan, as one cannon
shell burst with a terrific detonation less than
one hundred feet to the left of the <em>Flyer</em> and
almost keeled it over sidewise. “This is getting
too hot for me. They think we’re a new type
of German Zeppelin. Shoot her up higher, Ned.
Let’s get out of here quick.”</p>

<p>“I’ll raise her higher, of course,” answered
Ned, at the wheel, “but it’s a shame that we
can’t get a closer view of Paris in wartime.
That would be something to tell the folks about
when we get back home.”</p>

<p>Cr&mdash;cr&mdash;cra-sh! Boom!</p>

<p>The whole metal-plated frame of the <em>Flyer</em>
shook violently and careened wildly to one side
from the concussion of another lyddite shell.
Only quick action on Ned’s part prevented their
capsizing.</p>

<p>“We won’t ever get home to tell anybody
about anything if you don’t drive the ship higher
pretty soon,” yelled Alan.</p>

<p>Ned was the cooler of the two.</p>

<p>“All right,” said he, “but I do wish that
you could manage to signal some of these aeroplanes<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
skimming around us that we are friends
instead of enemies, and that we want to alight
down there in the city.”</p>

<p>Alan looked doubtful, but finally agreed. As
Ned jammed the elevation lever down hard in
its socket and forced the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> slowly
forward on a decided up-slant, his chum made
his way out onto the runway which encircled
most of the <em>Flyer’s</em> hull, and there, clinging
firmly to the iron taffrail with one hand, wig-wagged
pacific signals with a white flag gripped
in the other.</p>

<p>Either the circling French aviators did not
understand his signals, or thought that the white
flag was merely intended to deceive them, for all
save one of them totally disregarded it. That
single dare-devil bird-man drove his monoplane&mdash;like
a flea going against an elephant&mdash;straight,
head-on, at the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> the moment
Alan made his appearance outside. His face
was set in frantic determination.</p>

<p>A startled cry of warning escaped the boy
clinging in the terrific wind there on the narrow
runway, who thought that the madman intended
to crash into the bigger airship and so sacrifice
his own life in the attempt to disable the
supposed enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[85]</span></p>

<p>But that was not the daring Frenchman’s
intent. When the roar of his whirling tail propellers
deafened Alan’s hearing and it seemed
as if in another second the little monoplane
would be dashed against the <em>Flyer</em>, the Frenchman
tilted his planes sharply, swerved on a
perilous angle that almost overturned his light
craft, and, as he swept past in a rush of wind,
jerked a revolver from his belt with one hand
and fired full into Alan’s blanched face. A
second later he swooped down towards the
watching city below.</p>

<p>Alan felt a sudden stinging sensation on his
cheek and could not suppress a cry of pain.
Something warm began to trickle down his
cheek. A sudden giddiness made his head swim.
His eyes blurred and he felt that he might topple
over the narrow taffrail at any moment.</p>

<p>Blindly he groped behind him for the handle
of the door leading back into the ship&mdash;found
it, tried to call for help&mdash;then stumbled forward
and sank huddled to the airship floor unconscious.</p>

</div>


<p>Both Ned and Buck were too busily engaged
in getting the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> out of range of the
aerial guns to miss Alan for fully ten minutes.
They shot the airship almost obliquely upwards
over the city until the clouds shut off all sight
of it from them and even the most daring of the
pestering French aeroplanes could follow them
no higher. Then Ned noticed for the first time
that Alan had not returned to the pilot house.</p>

<p>“Is Alan down there in the engine room with
you, Buck?” he called through the speaking
tube.</p>

<p>“No. Good gracious! Isn’t he with you
either?” exclaimed Buck anxiously. “Everything
here seems to be running smoothly, so I’m
going to risk leaving it a few minutes to look
for him.”</p>

<p>It was not a hard matter to find Alan where
he lay huddled up just inside the port door.
With a cry of consternation Buck dropped upon
his knees beside the silent figure, turned it over<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
gently and was shocked to note the bloody
ghastliness of his comrade’s face.</p>

<p>Severe newspaper training was strong in Buck
Stewart though. He did not turn squeamish or
raise Ned’s anxieties by shouting that Alan had
been wounded. Ned needed his whole mind for
the management of the Flyer, and Buck realized
that.</p>

<p>Gathering the insensible boy up in his arms,
Buck carried him into one of the small staterooms,
hurriedly bathed his face in warm water,
and was relieved to discover that what had at
first appeared to be a mortal wound was merely
an abrasion of the flesh where the Frenchman’s
bullet had grazed its way. Alan revived a few
minutes afterward, and while his legs were still
a little shaky he protested that he felt quite
his usual self.</p>

<p>After their hostile reception at Paris, the
Airship Boys realized that it would be folly to
attempt a similar daylight descent upon Muhlbruck,
where Bob Russell was imprisoned. Also
the appalling screech of bursting shells going
past had given them a heartfelt disinclination to
get the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> anywhere between the lines
of fire on the battle front.</p>

<p>Examination of a war map presented to them<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
by the editor of the New York <cite>Herald</cite> showed
plainly that the nearest trenches of the opposing
armies lay about forty miles to the northeast
of Paris, extending thence in the form of a
rough semicircle, indented towards the north,
for a length of nearly two hundred miles. One
end of this titanic battle front ended on the
shores of the North Sea in Belgium; the other
in French territory in the Meuse prefecture. In
order to reach Muhlbruck it was necessary for
the <em>Flyer</em> to pass directly over the firing-lines
somewhere in the Ardennes forest region, and
then to proceed northerly, tending somewhat to
the east until crossing the Belgian frontier, near
which Muhlbruck is situated. The latest reports
of the war showed the fiercest fighting just then
to be going on far to the south along the river
Meuse, and northwesterly along the Aisne, a
few miles within French territory, where the
Germans were making desperate daily assaults
upon the allied French and English intrenchments.
The severe guerrilla fighting which had
nearly turned the Ardennes region into a
shambles had then ceased almost entirely, while
General von Kluck, commanding the German
army of the west, was endeavoring to force the
arms of his crescent battle line westward in<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
around the Allied forces and by so doing compel
them either to be surrounded and captured, or
else to fall back upon Paris once more.</p>

<p>“It looks to me,” said Ned, outlining the
positions on the map with one finger, “that it
will be best for us to cross the firing line there
in the Ardennes, flying high so as to be out of
the range of those tremendous German field guns
which they say can carry a cannon ball fifteen
miles or more. If you boys think well of it, we
might even drop the <em>Flyer</em> in the Ardennes
forest, get a chance to stretch the cramps out
of our legs there, and still get to Muhlbruck
long before dark.”</p>

<p>Both Alan and Buck approved heartily of this
plan and so it was decided upon. Estimating
the distance between their present position and
the Ardennes by their maps and instruments,
the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> proceeded on its way, concealed
from sight by the heavy cloud banks beneath.
While the sun was still high, they saw that they
had arrived somewhere in the neighborhood of
the intended stopping-place. Ned then began
planing as straight downwards as he dared and
shortly afterwards shouted:</p>

<p>“There it is, boys! We figured the time and
distance exactly. There are the tree-tops!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[90]</span></p>

<p>Sure enough, there extended the green expanse
of the great Ardennes wood, with the dull glint
of the setting sun gilding the leaves and
branches. Afar in the distance, a mere speck
in the flame-colored sky, a solitary observation
balloon was ascending. Somewhere away to the
northwards the dull, monotonous booming of
cannon could be heard like the rumble of distant
thunder. The woods showed no signs of life;
there were no spirals of smoke rising into the
still evening air to warn the young aeronauts of
near-by camp fires.</p>

<p>Sailing slowly over the tree-tops and gradually
dropping lower and lower, the <em>Flyer</em> finally came
upon an open glade perhaps half a mile square
and ideally located for a landing. Its only
obstruction was a clump of maybe half a dozen
ancient oaks standing almost in the middle of
the area.</p>

<p>There Ned brought the big airship to earth as
lightly as a bird, and the three boys jumped
out to enjoy their first touch of Mother Earth
since leaving New York nearly a day before.
The air was mild and odoriferous with the smell
of the forest and all took huge breaths of it
gratefully. Buck pranced about like a colt let
loose in pasture, and he and Alan ran short<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
races up and down the glade to stretch their
cramped muscles.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” called Ned, “it is time that we
held a serious council of war to decide just how
we are going to manage Bob’s escape. Let’s
sit down under these trees here and make final
arrangements, because by midnight we’ll be at
Muhlbruck and won’t want to waste any time in
that dangerous vicinity.”</p>

<p>So they sat there under the biggest tree in
the center of the field and talked things over.</p>

<p>Alan said: “I don’t see how we can decide
upon any very definite plan until after we get
there and find out the lie of the land. For all
that we know, the prison where they have Bob
locked up may be right in the center of the town
with a couple thousand watchful soldiers around
it. I don’t believe that we’ll ever be able to get
near enough to the prison to get Bob out without
some leg-work.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking of that too,” said Ned,
“and feel pretty sure that some one of us will
have to go into town disguised to get exact
information, while the other two of us remain to
guard the <em>Flyer</em> and be ready to lend assistance
whenever we are called upon. The difficulty is
to say which one of us ought to undertake the<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
perilous mission of spy. You know if the Germans
ever caught him he would be in an even
worse fix than poor old Bob.”</p>

<p>“Let me go, Ned,” pleaded Alan, his face
aglow with enthusiasm. “I’m perfectly willing
to take the risk.”</p>

<p>“No, let me go,” said Buck. “Both of you
boys are absolutely needed to manage the airship,
and in a pinch can get along well enough
without me. Besides that, I can speak German
well enough to pass in the dark, and my newspaper
work has given me more practical experience
in the sleuthing line than either of you two
have had.</p>

<p>“Personally I don’t think the chances are
that I would run much danger of detection there
in disguise after midnight, but, even if they do
get suspicious, I could show them the war-correspondent’s
credentials given you by the
<cite>Herald</cite>. I don’t believe that even grouchy old
General Haberkampf is crazy enough to risk
getting the American press down on him by mistreatment
of me should I have to shove those
papers under his nose.”</p>

<p>“I think that you exaggerate the importance
of the New York <cite>Herald</cite> over here in the war
zone,” said Alan with a smile. “Remember<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
that the <cite>Herald</cite> card didn’t prevent the Germans
from throwing Bob into their beastly prison.”</p>

<p>“But that was quite a different case,”
explained Buck. “Bob Russell was caught with
certain papers on his person which are said to
have branded him as a hostile spy.”</p>

<p>“However&mdash;” began Alan again.</p>

<p>Ned interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Buck is right, Alan,” said he. “I don’t
like to think of his risking his life in this way,
but he is clearly better fitted for the job than
either you or I. I understand how disappointed
you are in not getting the chance to risk it for
good old Bob’s sake, and I’m just as sorry that
I can’t do it. But Buck’s knowledge of the
German language, his experience in this sort
of thing, and the fact that he can the better
bluff about being a regular newspaper correspondent,
all make him the logical man for it.
You and I will have to give in.”</p>

<p>Alan was very much disappointed that things
turned out so and tossed back his head to conceal
his chagrin. As he did so his eye caught
sight of something strange in the bushy tree-top
directly above their heads.</p>

<p>“Look, boys, isn’t that a little house up
there?” he cried, pointing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[94]</span></p>

<p>As he did so there came a chorus of guttural
exclamations from the concealing leaves up
above, and, before the startled Airship Boys had
time to do more than scramble to their feet, at
least a dozen shaggy-bearded German soldiers,
in ragged, dirt-stained gray uniforms, came
sliding one after another down the surrounding
tree-trunks.</p>

<p>“Hands up!” roared one who seemed to be
in command, and, even though he spoke in
German, there was no mistaking the meaning of
the musket barrels pointed threateningly at the
three boys.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE FIGHT IN THE FOREST</span></h2>
</div>


<p>For an instant the heart of each boy stood
still. Then things began to happen. Ned shot
straight from his hip, the revolver bullet tearing
its way straight through his coat pocket and
wounding the nearest soldier.</p>

<p>Buck grappled closely with the soldier closest
to him, beat down the threatening gun muzzle,
felt the discharge scorch his leg in passing, and
rolled over and over on the ground, arms interlocked
in deadly combat.</p>

<p>Alan sprang behind the nearest tree and
opened fire on the assailants, with a revolver in
each hand spitting lead as fast he could pull the
trigger.</p>

<p>Muskets belched flame and smoke in a half-circle
around them, but Ned was safely behind
a sheltering tree-trunk before the deadly leaden
hail could reach him. Another soldier fell,
howling with pain, and a third clapped one hand
to his shoulder where a well-sped bullet from
Alan’s revolver had lodged. The Germans took<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
shelter behind adjacent trees, as the boys had
done, and only Buck and his opponent still rolled
out, exposed to fire. Yet neither the boys or the
Germans dared shoot at the struggling men for
fear of wounding one of their own party.</p>

<p>Ned cast a longing, regretful eye at the <em>Ocean
Flyer</em> where it stood not fifty yards away. He
blamed himself for their folly in ever leaving its
protecting walls. Besides, he knew that their
revolvers were nearly empty and that they had
no spare cartridges in their pockets.</p>

<p>He shouted to Alan in English, which the
Germans could not of course understand, to
work his way back towards the airship.</p>

<p>Dodging from tree to tree, the two boys gradually
came within about twenty yards of the
<em>Flyer</em>. In the meantime, the Germans had
divined their intentions and had followed them
closely, keeping up a hot fire all the time. The
intervening distance between the airship and
the boys would have to be covered by a dash
across the exposed open ground, where the Germans
could hardly fail to get them.</p>

<p>“Don’t risk it, Ned,” cried Alan.</p>

<p>“One of us absolutely must,” answered the
other boy desperately. “We are all lost if we
don’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[97]</span></p>

<p>Then before Alan could protest further, the
courageous lad darted from cover and was
bounding across the dangerous open space
towards the <em>Flyer</em>.</p>

<p>Twenty German bullets went hissing after him
and the entire crowd pursued with hoarse shouts
of rage. Alan bowled over one of them as he
ran, and then himself rushed after Ned. None
of the soldiers took time to pause, aim and
shoot. They were too anxious to catch the
fleeing boys.</p>

<p>Up the swaying rope ladder leading to the
open portway clambered Ned, with Alan crowding
close on his heels. The former threw
himself inside, but the Germans were too close
for Alan to risk it. He felt hot breath on
the back of his neck, heard the man behind
him panting heavily, and, with one foot on the
first rung of the ladder, wheeled with clubbed
revolver to defend himself. His arm swung
back to dash it into the man’s face, when&mdash;</p>

<p>“<em>Buck!</em>” cried he.</p>

<p>It was the reporter, who had finally succeeded
in mastering his assailant and had followed his
two chums in their desperate race for the safety
of the <em>Flyer</em>.</p>

<p>There was no time for further conversation,<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
however, for the yelling Germans were now fairly
on top of them. Alan’s revolvers snapped harmlessly.
They were empty. Buck fired his
remaining four bullets right into their faces
and then struck out with his fists. It looked as
if it were all up with the brave boys until suddenly
Ned appeared on the airship runway
overhead. In his hand he held raised a black,
round, metal object about the size of a football.</p>

<p>“Stand back!” he shouted in a terrible tone.
“Every one of you Germans stand back or I
swear I will blow you all to pieces with this
lyddite grenade!”</p>

<p>The deadly explosive hung there almost above
their heads and every man of them knew what
it was.</p>

<p>Involuntarily they fell back, and in that minute
while they hesitated, Alan and Buck bounded up
the companion-ladder into safety in the hold of
the airship. As the metal door clanged shut
and locked automatically behind them, they
heard the enraged Germans hammering upon it
with the butts of their muskets.</p>

<p>“To your engines, Buck!” shouted Ned from
above. “Quick! Alan, help me in the pilot
house here!”</p>

<p>The starting lever was jammed down into<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
place. The hum of the great turbines became
a roar. The huge propellers swished mightily
round and round. The <em>Ocean Flyer</em> began to
slip over the grass, with the frantic Germans
giving ground reluctantly. Then the huge bulk
gradually lifted itself from the earth and
skimmed like a swallow heavenwards over the
now dusky tree-tops. German bullets rattled
like hail over the metal sides of the vessel.</p>

<p>Alan smiled grimly at Ned.</p>

<p>“They don’t realize that magnalium alloy is
as good as armor plate,” he said. “Unless a
stray bullet happens to snap some mechanical
part of the tail propellers, they’re welcome to
shoot as much as they want to now.”</p>

<p>Ned nodded as he shaped the <em>Flyer’s</em> course
towards the north where the frontier and Muhlbruck
lay.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">BUCK TAKES HIS LIFE IN HIS HANDS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Black night had already fallen, blotting out
sight of all lower landmarks, and the Airship
Boys had only their maps and instruments by
which to guide their path. But, as had been
before proved, those were ample for the purpose.</p>

<p>The young aeronauts were unable to tell just
when they passed over the long zig-zagging
double line of trenches, which marked where
the hostile armies crouched, menacing each
other, because all camp fires were blanketed
there. Experience in the early days of the war
had taught both Germans and Allies that a
shining camp fire is an excellent mark for bombs
from any prowling aviator overhead.</p>

<p>Several villages sparsely lighted, and several
cities with all lights extinguished, were passed
over before the <em>Flyer</em> reached a point where the
boys knew that Muhlbruck must lie very nearly
below them. They planed down gently, found
no place adequate for a safe landing, and finally
were forced to circle uncertainly there in mid-air,<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
straining their eyes down into the gloom
below. They did not dare to investigate the lie
of the land with their searchlights, as that
would instantly have betrayed their presence
to everyone within miles of the spot.</p>

<p>At last Alan observed a comparatively open
and flat stretch of ground, and they decided to
take a chance on it. Fortunately it proved to
afford a better landing area than had been
apparent from above, and the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> was
once more brought to rest on firm ground.</p>

<p>The boys instantly discovered that they were
in a large farmyard, with a broad, dusty highway
on the one side and a small unlighted
cottage near by. They were afraid at first that
the inhabitants, if there were any, had observed
their approach and had slipped away to give
warning.</p>

<p>Further examination of the premises showed
this dread to be groundless, however. As they
stealthily tiptoed around the cottage, the boys
could plainly see that war had long since passed
that way and driven off its occupants. The walls
were charred with fire, half of the straw-thatched
roof had fallen in and the door swung crazily
askew on one hinge.</p>

<p>Investigation on the inside made clear that<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
whoever the owners were, they had left in great
haste. Furniture was broken and overturned;
linen, bed-clothes and wearing apparel lay scattered
all over the floor. One wall was riddled
with bullets.</p>

<p>Stooping, Buck gave vent to a pleased exclamation.
He had found enough old clothes out of
which to disguise himself completely as a Belgian
peasant. Even the clumsy wooden shoes were
unearthed from one corner of the room.</p>

<p>“This simplifies everything,” he cried to Alan.
“I’ll put these things on right now and be off
into town to see how things are. Unless I’m
much mistaken, this road beside us is the main
highway into Muhlbruck, which itself can’t be
much more than a mile away if those maps of
ours are correct.</p>

<p>“In the meantime, you and Ned can wait
here for me. If I’m still alive and at liberty,
I’ll be back here by sun-up sure. If I don’t
show up by then, you can rest assured that
something unforeseen has happened to detain
me. In case anyone comes snooping around
here while I am gone, you boys had better go
aloft in the <em>Flyer</em> and return here again for me
to-morrow night. But be sure and wait here
until daylight for me, unless you are discovered.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[103]</span></p>

<p>This plan was about the best that any of the
boys could suggest, so Buck donned the old
clothes he had found, dirtied his face with dust
from the roadway and bade his chums good-bye
cheerfully. They stared regretfully after his
retreating figure in the gloom.</p>

<p>“If anything happens to him, I never shall
forgive myself,” said Ned.</p>

<p>Alan laughed in a brave attempt to seem
lighter-hearted than he was.</p>

<p>“If anybody can come through this stunt
safely, it’s Buck Stewart,” he said. “Mark
my words, he’ll be back here chipper as a sparrow
by sunrise, with a full plan of how and when
we are to rescue Bob.”</p>

<p>“I certainly hope so,” muttered Ned,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Buck was striding rapidly along
the road into town, with his cap pulled low over
his eyes and his right hand nursing the handle
of a big revolver in his hip pocket. He skulked
mostly along the side of the way, where the black
shadows from the hedges tended to conceal him.
His eyes kept shifting warily from left to right
and his ears were strained to catch any sound
that might warn him of other prowlers on the
road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>Frequently he passed wayside graves&mdash;sometimes
a single mound of earth; at other times a
number of them side by side. Every somber
mound of earth was marked by a wooden cross,
on the apex of many of which the fallen soldier’s
hat was hung. Buck noticed that in many cases,
the rough cap of a French infantryman hung
side by side with battered German helmets. The
German army does everything neatly, thoroughly.
Whenever there is time it buries the fallen enemy
as well as its own dead.</p>

<p>By and by little gloomy houses began to
appear straggling along the wayside and Buck
knew then that he was in the outskirts of the
town. No lights were shown in any of the
windows. Not a cow lowed, nor dog barked.
The hush of either dread or desertion seemed
heavy in the dark night air.</p>

<p>Buck had not gone much farther when he was
startled by a sharp:</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wer geht da?</i>” (Who goes there?) as a
stalwart, gray-cloaked sentry stepped out from
the shadows of the roadside, with leveled and
bayoneted musket.</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ein Freund, ein armer Landsmann, Excellenz</i>,”
(a friend, a poor farmer, your excellency)
answered Buck, gripping his revolver firmly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[105]</span></p>

<p>“Stand out in the middle of the road where
I can see you more plainly in the moonlight,”
gruffly ordered the sentinel, poking at the seeming
peasant with his sharp bayonet.</p>

<p>Buck obeyed him, feigning great humility.
There was nothing suspicious to the German in
his appearance, but&mdash;</p>

<p>“What are you doing out so late and alone on
the highroad here?” demanded the sentry.</p>

<p>“Excellency, three weeks ago I had a home&mdash;such
a nice cozy little place!&mdash;down the road a
mile or so. I ran away into Muhlbruck when
your army marched past on the road to Paris,
and to-day I went back to see if there was anything
left for me.”</p>

<p>“And did you find anything, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Landsmann</i>?”</p>

<p>“No, excellency. The place was swept clean;
even the nice little cottage was half torn down.”</p>

<p>The burly German guffawed, as if at a huge
joke.</p>

<p>“Now I know that you are telling me the
truth, fellow,” he said. “I know your place
well. Why, I myself helped burst in the door
you locked so carefully on leaving. But you
don’t bear me any ill-will for that, do you,
now?”</p>

<p>“No, excellency.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[106]</span></p>

<p>“You had better not,” growled the sentry.
“Pass on and don’t let me catch you prowling
around here any more of nights. I have orders
to shoot anybody whose looks I don’t like.”</p>

<p>“Yes, excellency, I will remember,” said the
seeming peasant, and slunk away in the direction
of the town.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">“TO BE SHOT AT SUNRISE!”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The streets of the town were unlighted, but
several houses on the public square showed
illumination through lowered window shades.
There were no citizens to be seen, and very few
soldiers about. In front of the Hotel de Ville
(townhall) a sentry paced restlessly to and fro
on duty, with a musket laid across his arm. He
took no notice of the dirty peasant stalking past.</p>

<p>Buck made it his first business to locate the
civic prison where he knew that Bob would be
confined. This he found not far from the main
thoroughfare of the town, a massive, square,
gray-stone building, with iron doors and many
little grated windows high up on the walls. A
sentry-box beside the door was occupied, so
Buck spent no time loitering around there. He
made his way back to the public square in search
of an inn where he might sit down, and while
eating inquire casually about news in general
and the trials of war prisoners in particular. He
felt pretty sure that the down-trodden Belgians<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
present were sullen and discontented under the
iron German rule, and would be willing to discuss
almost any topic relative to the oppressions.</p>

<p>The first tavern to which Buck came was large
and pretentious; evidently the main hostelry of
the city. Even at this late hour people were
passing in and out of the big entrance. The
disguised boy noted, however, that many of
these guests were German officers, and rightly
guessed that this being the chief inn of the city,
it would be most largely patronized by the conquerors,
so he passed on in search of some less
popular place.</p>

<p>A little farther on down the street he came
upon a smaller, more dingy-looking public house,
with apparently less revelry going on inside.
Buck determined to take a chance here, and,
pulling his disreputable cap lower over his eyes,
pulled open the door and slouched in.</p>

<p>He found himself in a small, low-ceilinged
room, the walls and oaken rafters of which were
dirty and smoked black by the huge open fireplace
at one end. Rickety little wooden tables
stood here and there, none too clean nor inviting.
A doorway at the far end of the room led out
into the kitchens, from which a vile odor of
cabbage and onions penetrated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[109]</span></p>

<p>There were only a few people present, and
they appeared to be merely scared townsfolk.
Buck dropped into a chair at one of the greasy
tables, and a slatternly servant-maid took his
order for something to eat.</p>

<p>While she was serving him a little later on,
she said:</p>

<p>“I do not recognize you as one of our regular
customers, goodman. Are you a stranger in
Muhlbruck?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Buck, “I was a farmer near
Dinant before this war broke out, but since then&mdash;well,
you know how it is!”</p>

<p>“We here in Muhlbruck should know if anybody
does,” grumbled the girl. “The Germans
have overrun the town, taken all the best for
themselves, half of the time without paying for
it, and treat us honest people as if we were born
their servants. Now, old General Haberkampf,
who is in command of the division stationed
here, is throwing all of our best citizens into
prison on trumped-up charges of one kind or
another.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Buck. “Is he doing such an
outrageous thing as that? But then, maybe he
thinks that they are playing him double&mdash;are
spies, in other words.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[110]</span></p>

<p>“Bah! Spies nothing!” exclaimed the girl
indignantly. “That is an old yarn! There is
that young American newspaper correspondent
now! The Germans have thrown him into prison
too and claim that papers were found upon him.
And now they are going to shoot him at sunrise
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“<em>To shoot him at sunrise?</em>” ejaculated Buck,
with difficulty restraining himself from showing
his agitation. “Surely you cannot mean that!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I do,” replied the girl. “They tried
him before a military tribunal in the Hotel de
Ville this afternoon. No outsiders were admitted,
and that beast of a General Haberkampf wastes
no time in carrying out his decisions. The poor
young man will be taken out and shot at sunrise
in the fields just west of the town. That is
where all these ‘acts of justice’ have been
taking place since the terrible Germans came to
Muhlbruck.</p>

<p>“They back the condemned man up against
the remaining wall of the old church there; the
firing squad stands off at a distance of thirty
paces; ‘Ready! Aim! Fire!’ says the corporal
in charge, and pouff! another life is snuffed out.”</p>

<p>Buck was horror-stricken at the terrible fate
that threatened his old friend within less than<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
three or four hours. Almost the Airship Boys
had come too late, and even now it was a question
whether or not he could get back to the airship
and make plans for a rescue in time to
save him.</p>

<p>Buck easily recalled the place set for the
execution. He had passed it not a hundred yards
from the highroad, about a quarter of a mile
from town.</p>

<p>His brain was in a whirl. He was unable to
formulate any practicable scheme of effecting
the rescue. The sun at that time of year rose
about five o’clock, or five-thirty at the latest.
All preparations must be made before then.</p>

<p>Paying his bill at the inn, Buck hurried out
into the damp night air again and set out for
the place where he had left his comrades. Once
clear of the town, he broke into a run.
Approaching the vicinity of the sentinel who
had challenged him on his way in about an hour
before, the reporter made a wide detour through
the dew-wet fields to the left of the road. He
got by that danger point in safety, struck the
highway again and resumed his breathless race
against time.</p>

<p>Finally, panting with his exertions and bathed
in perspiration, he arrived at the peasant’s<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
ruined hut and saw the vast black shape of the
<em>Ocean Flyer</em> looming up behind it. Then something
icy cold and round was suddenly pressed
against the back of his neck, strong arms
pinioned his arms to his sides, and a voice said
sternly in English:</p>

<p>“Not so fast there! One outcry and you are
a dead man. Where do you think you are
going?”</p>

<p>“Alan!” breathed Buck in relief. “Don’t
shoot! It is I&mdash;Buck Stewart&mdash;with news of
Bob.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Alan. “Come along over
to the <em>Flyer</em> where Ned is anxiously waiting.
You are back sooner than we expected.”</p>

<p>It did not take Buck long to tell his story.</p>

<p>“Now,” said he, “what’s to be done? We
have less than three hours left to do it if ever
we want to see Bob alive again.”</p>

<p>Half a dozen wild plans were suggested and
discarded as quickly. Finally it was resourceful
Ned who said:</p>

<p>“Let’s work it this way, boys. You, Buck,
will have to go back afoot to the ruined church
where the execution is to be, and wait there
until the firing squad arrives with Bob at sunrise.
Hide behind the wall against which they<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
back him up to be shot, and then, when they are
pacing off the firing distance, jump out, cut his
bonds and run around to the other side of the
wall again with him. With a couple of loaded
revolvers in each of your hands and one of you
at each end of the wall, you ought to be able to
keep even the dozen soldiers in the guard at bay
until we can arrive.</p>

<p>“We will have the <em>Flyer</em> all ready for instant
flight the minute the squad shows up, and at the
first shot, we’ll be on hand. At the rate of
speed we can travel we oughtn’t to be more than
a few moments covering the distance. A couple
of hand grenades tossed down among those
Germans ought to send them about their business
pretty quickly.</p>

<p>“Of course I know that this is a pretty risky
plan, but it’s the best we have been able to hit
upon so far.”</p>

<p>“But won’t those soldiers be able to shoot
Buck down before he has time to free Bob of
his bonds?” Alan queried. “Buck can’t be
shooting at them and cutting the rope off Bob’s
hands at the same time?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so,” answered Ned. “I
believe that it is customary for only a certain
number of guns in a firing squad to be actually<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
loaded with bullets. Blank cartridges are used
in the others, and no soldier knows just who
carries the fatal weapons. This is to keep any
self-respecting man among them from feeling
that he is committing cold-blooded murder by
shooting down a prisoner with his hands tied.
Undoubtedly the officer in charge will be loading
the guns while poor Bob is being given a last
chance to think it over. That’s the time.”</p>

<p>“You think of every little point, Ned,” cried
Buck admiringly. “Of course I’ll go and do my
best to save Bob. As time is slipping away fast,
I’d better set off right now, too. But remember
that you are to show up the minute you hear
the first shot fired.”</p>

<p>“Count on that, old boy,” answered both of
the others.</p>

<p>Then, with four “six-shooters” weighting
down his coat pockets, Buck Stewart again disappeared
into the night.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE RESCUE</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Buck arrived at the ruined church just as the
first pallid gray of morning light was smudging
the eastern sky line. The air was cold and damp.
It bit to the bone. Shivering, the reporter drew
his coat more tightly around him, made sure
for the eleventh time that his supply of revolvers
was all loaded and in good working order, and
then tramped up and down on that side of the
crumbling wall which best sheltered him from
the wind.</p>

<p>The hush of dawn pervaded the entire landscape.
Not a single human being was to be seen.</p>

<p>Gradually the dull light on the horizon spread
up into the sky and widened. It changed color
from yellow to pink, and finally the sun rose
through the mist of the deserted fields like a
great round globe of fire.</p>

<p>A quarter of a mile distant the chimes of the
cathedral in Muhlbruck could be faintly heard,
calling the people to early mass. Somewhere
far off to the right a cock crew lustily, welcoming<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
the sunlight. Little birds began to chirp and
hop through the grass.</p>

<p>It was the time!</p>

<p>Waiting in that way was unbearable to Buck.
The strain on his nerves drove him nearly
frantic. Once more he took out his revolvers
for examination, paced restlessly up and down,
up and down, and wished that they would come.</p>

<p>A distant rumble far down the highway warned
him of other travelers. He crouched down
behind the wall, fingering his weapons with
heart-strings taut&mdash;waiting, watching.</p>

<p>Finally a vehicle hove in sight, but it was
only a farmer’s cart drawn by two big black
dogs, and loaded with vegetables for sale in
town. The blue-smocked peasant striding alongside
was whistling a little song, all unconscious
of the grim-faced figure behind the old church.</p>

<p>The cart vanished around a bend in the road
towards Muhlbruck. Then all was silence again.
The sun rose higher, dissipating the mist before
its warmth. It was not fully daylight. Then
it was that Buck’s straining ear caught the
distant rhythmic footbeats of marching men. It
was the firing squad with Bob.</p>

<p>Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp!</p>

<p>Around the bend in the road they came, a<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
dozen soldiers whose uniforms and spiked helmets
were a dull gray, like the dust they stirred up
underfoot. They marched in a little column of
twos, with a corporal in command at one side.
In their midst was the condemned prisoner.</p>

<p>The watching Buck was moved to great pity
at his old friend’s haggard and unkempt appearance.
There were great bluish hollows under
his eyes, his cheeks were unnaturally pale, and
the growth of a two-weeks’ beard made his face
almost unrecognizable. But, although he knew
that they were taking him to his death, Bob
marched with shoulders squared and his head
thrown back. It would never do for an American
to show fear before foreigners.</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zum Recht! Halt!</i>” (Wheel to the right!
Halt!) snapped the corporal.</p>

<p>The firing squad was now on the other side
of the wall from Buck, standing like so many
statues, with their rifles stiffly presented.</p>

<p>The corporal grasped Bob roughly by the arm
and backed him up against the wall.</p>

<p>“If you wish to pray, do so now,” he said
in German. “Make it brief.”</p>

<p>Bob closed his eyes for a few moments, while
he thought of his old friends away back in New
York, wondering what had become of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>“I am ready, corporal,” said he, shortly.</p>

<p>His hands were bound tightly together behind
his back and a bandage tied over his eyes.</p>

<p>“Pace your distance,” the officer ordered his
men.</p>

<p>They retreated for about thirty paces, the
corporal counting gruffly: “Hup! hup! hup!”
as they marched.</p>

<p>It was at that instant that Buck Stewart
darted around the corner of the old wall with
a sharp knife in his hands. He was at Bob’s
side and in a trice had slashed the rope free of
his hands. The blindfold followed in less time
than it takes to tell it.</p>

<p>Just then the firing squad reached their
appointed position and wheeled machine-like
about. They saw in a flash their prisoner about
to escape.</p>

<p>“Donnerwetter!” roared the corporal, brandishing
his sword. “Fire, men! Shoot them
down!”</p>

<p>The roar of a dozen German muskets crashed
out just as the boys turned the corner of the
wall. The bullets shattered the masonry in a
cloud of flying debris. Buck shoved two big
revolvers into Bob’s hands as they dashed behind
the wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[119]</span></p>

<p>“Stand guard there at the other end of the
wall, Bob,” he shouted. “I’ll take care of this
end.”</p>

<div id="Ref_118" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i123.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><em>The Rescue of Bob Russell.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Then, before the Germans had scarcely recovered
from their surprise, each boy was
peppering away at them in deadly fashion from
opposite ends of the protecting masonry. Their
first fusillade brought down three groaning
soldiers, one of them the corporal. The rest
made for cover, the nearest shelter&mdash;the tumbled
masonry of the church itself.</p>

<p>“Spread out on each side of the young
devils!” yelled the raging German corporal from
where he lay. “Scatter and surround them!
Work up on them from behind!”</p>

<p>His commands were quickly obeyed, and even
such a rapid fire as the boys were able to pour
into the enemy could not prevent three or four
of them from running far around on either side,
where, lying flat in the long weeds, they opened
a dangerous flank-fire that immediately made
the wall of no further protection to its gallant
defenders.</p>

<p>“It’s all up with us now,” called Bob, as he
took another ineffective shot at one of the
sharp-shooters.</p>

<p>“If only the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> would come!”<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
groaned Buck. “I can’t understand why it
hasn’t arrived before this!”</p>

<p>At that moment, as if in answer to his desperate
cry, there came the ominous roar of a
powerful motor, high up in the air, and there
came the great airship, swooping down with its
seventy-two feet of planes magnificently outspread,
and Alan Hope standing out on the
lower runway, swinging deadly bombs in his
hand.</p>

<p>The Germans saw the approach of the strange
aircraft at the same instant, and startled cries
of: “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ein Flieger! Ein Flieger!</i>” (an airship)
broke from them as they diverted part of their
fire upon it.</p>

<p>The <em>Flyer</em> swept on down in gradually narrowing
circles and lessened speed until it hung
almost directly over the hard-pressed boys by
the wall. Then a hundred-foot rope ladder, one
end of which was attached to an opened port, was
tossed down to them and Alan, making a megaphone
of his hands, shouted:</p>

<p>“Climb up! Quick! There is a whole division
of cavalry dashing down the road!”</p>

<p>Buck caught the loose end of the ladder first,
and ran up the tough spruce rungs like a monkey,
despite the sway of the rope supports. Bob did<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
his best to weight down the end of the ladder
with one hand, while with the other he emptied
his remaining pistol at the Germans who now
came at him in a body and on the run. Chips
of masonry from the wall were flying all around
his head as the bullets struck it.</p>

<p>Buck reached the top of the ladder and was
dragged safely inside through the porthole,
while Bob made a flying leap, caught the fifth
rung and began to climb as fast as he could.
German bullets whizzed past his ears, but fortunately
none hit him. As he climbed, he
yelled:</p>

<p>“Tell Ned to shoot her on up into the sky!
Full speed! I’ll be up there with you in a
minute or two!”</p>

<p>Buck rushed to the engine room, while Alan
hurried to tell Ned. The porthole was left open
so that Bob could crawl in. Ned was excited;
with his right hand he jammed the long starting-lever
down as far as it would go; with his
left he tugged at the lever of the lateral control
rudder. It stuck. With both hands he gave
one desperate pull. The sudden give, and
the quick swerve upward of the <em>Flyer</em> threw him
off his balance. He lunged heavily against the
rod. It broke off short in his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[122]</span></p>

<p>The sudden burst of power shot the big airship
suddenly skyward on an angle of almost eighty
degrees and with a suddenness which nearly
threw both Ned and Alan off their feet. The
huge propeller began to whirl with dizzying
velocity, and the wind screeched and whined
through the propellers like an animal in pain.</p>

<p>With blanched cheeks both boys bent low over
the broken lever, but though they broke their
finger-nails trying to loosen it, they were unable
to pry it up even with such tools as they could
lay their hands on.</p>

<p>Horror showed in each face. With a ghastly
attempt at composure Ned turned to Alan.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve certainly done it now!” he
groaned. “There seems to be no hope of being
able to pry that broken lever up. And I don’t
dare to shut off the speed; no telling what would
happen going at this angle. At present it is
driving the <em>Flyer</em> at maximum speed almost
straight upwards into the sky!”</p>

<p>Alan was speechless, and could only gulp; his
eyes were bulging in mortal terror.</p>

<p>At that moment a frantic call came up through
the tube from Buck.</p>

<p>“Great heavens, boys!” he screamed, “look
down below! There is Bob clinging sixty feet<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
down the ladder, beaten nearly insensible by the
terrible wind, and unable to climb further because
the current is sweeping that light rope ladder
straight out behind us like a ribbon. If we
don’t stop in a minute or so, he is as good as
dead!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum">[124]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN DEADLY PERIL</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Here was a condition the boys had never foreseen;
they were undoubtedly “rattled.” At
their present high speed the wings were folded
in their utmost. Let the speed be reduced, the
planes would automatically expand; they were
headed into the wind&mdash;an extra inch of surface
to catch the terrific pressure might cause the
<em>Flyer</em> to turn turtle.</p>

<p>The only possibility that remained for those
on board to save Bob was the desperate chance
that they might be able to haul the ladder in,
hand over hand, until the boy was near enough
to crawl into the hull himself. None of the boys
had much hope of being able to accomplish the
feat, and indeed the first minute of tugging on
the rope ladder convinced them that it was an
utter impossibility to haul it in against the
terrific wind current created by the machine.</p>

<p>“No hope!” sighed Buck, wiping the
perspiration from his face.</p>

<p>“Wait! I have it! Rig up that windlass in<span class="pagenum">[125]</span>
the storeroom. I’ll bet we can haul him in on
that,” exclaimed Alan.</p>

<p>The windlass was brought and the loose end
of the ladder finally lashed to it. The barrel
crank of the windlass they attached to one of the
machines in the engine room, and then the previous
ladder attachments were cut loose. Buck
started the donkey-engine, and all were delighted
to see that with each chug of the engine another
lap of the ladder was dragged aboard and
wound about the windlass.</p>

<p>Buck speeded the little engine up faster and
the clinging figure below rapidly rose from sixty
to fifty, to forty, to twenty, to ten, to two feet
of the porthole, when strong, eager arms were
outstretched to drag him aboard. Poor Bob
was so numb with cold and so exhausted from
the frightful strain he had undergone, that he
collapsed almost as soon as he found himself in
safety.</p>

<p>“Safety” is, however, no word to describe
the situation of the <em>Flyer’s</em> crew. The big airship
was shooting on, on, on at an abrupt angle
up into uncharted space, the limits of which
are beyond the deductions or comprehension of
science. The highest cloud strata had been surmounted
long since; a strange darkness seemed<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
to close over them, making it necessary to turn
on the electric lights.</p>

<p>The <em>Ocean Flyer</em> was passing into a region
of the most intense cold. First frost appeared
on the plate glass of the portholes; then this
rapidly thickened to a thick coating of ice which
prevented all view of the outside. Even the wind
funnel device on the <em>Flyer’s</em> prow, which had in
past flights proved practical in keeping the
interior heated, was now inadequate. The ship
became so cold that the boys’ breath steamed;
their hands turned blue and their noses reddened.
Soon it even became necessary for them
to put on their heaviest underclothing and fur
overcoats. They had to huddle close together
for warmth.</p>

<p>The altitude gauge began acting queerly; it
had long since passed the ten-mile mark.</p>

<p>The young aeronauts had the choice of only
two expedients in this desperate emergency.
They could keep on going as they were, trusting
to luck; or they might shut off the gas supply
and take a chance of having the <em>Flyer</em> turn on
its back. Their chances of coming right-side-up
were better now; there was no air-movement in
this high altitude. But suddenly Buck made a
discovery that made a choice unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[127]</span></p>

<p>“Look, fellows!” he cried, pointing at the
gauge which showed the angle of flight. “Sure
as you live, her nose is dropping every second.”</p>

<p>Ned nodded his head gravely. “I’ve been
hoping for that. The air’s getting too thin to
give the rudder enough resistance. Our speed’s
lessening every minute. We’ll soon be on an
even keel&mdash;and then we at least stand a chance.”</p>

<p>“Won’t we just drop like a rock?” gasped
Alan in dismay.</p>

<p>“Why no. Not if we keep our engines going.
We simply won’t gain any ground. I’ll give
you an exhibition of fancy flying about that
time. We’ll try ‘dodging.’”</p>

<p>“Play tag with the clouds?” grinned Buck.</p>

<p>“We’ll play tug-o’-war with our rudder. We’d
naturally drop headfirst without the propellers.
We’ll use our power just often enough and
strong enough to keep level. In other words,
we’ll jump down.”</p>

<p>“And where will we land?” asked Buck.
“We’re headed west, aren’t we?”</p>

<p>“We won’t be in Belgium when we see terra
firma, and I wouldn’t be surprised if we got
pretty well across Germany&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We can’t land there.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t land here, that’s sure. We’ve<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
got to take a chance. Me to the engines&mdash;we
start dropping in five minutes.”</p>

<p>The floor of the cabin was nearly level; then
it began to rock violently. From the alternate
hum and silence of the engines, the others knew
that Ned had begun the descent. Aside from
that, the airship was as steady as ever.</p>

<p>In the meantime Buck busied himself in the
cook’s galley, and when he finally emerged carrying
steaming hot pots of coffee and savory-smelling
victuals, you may well believe that the
half frozen boys greeted him with enthusiasm.
They shouted up to Ned through the speaking-tube:</p>

<p>“Lash the plane gears fast where they are
and come on down. Buck’s got ready a fine lot
of stuff for us to eat.”</p>

<p>“You boys go ahead and enjoy it without me
for a little while,” Ned answered from his place
in the pilot house. “I’m going to have just
one more try at that broken lever.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">NED SAVES THE “FLYER’S” CREW</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Dull despair gripped even the ordinarily
cheerful Ned’s heart as he stared at the broken
lever, flush with the metal work around the
socket where it had defied all efforts to pry it
up and loose. If only there were a half inch
or so of the lever still projecting above the
metal frame so that one might get a purchase
on it with pincers, or&mdash;</p>

<p>“Silly that I am!” shouted Ned. “Here we
have all been wasting our time and effort trying
to pry the lever up, when we can just as easily
rip off the metal top casing around the socket.
That will certainly leave at least three-quarters
of an inch of the lever sticking up where we can
get at it. Boys! Oh, boys! Come here, quick,
and bring some screw drivers, a cold chisel,
a hammer, and a pair of good strong plyers with
you!”</p>

<p>The other lads came running with the desired
tools and Ned explained his idea in a few words.
All looked at each other sheepishly, but with<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
vast relief they began at once to carry out Ned’s
instructions.</p>

<p>“What ninnies we were not to think of so
simple a thing long before this!” exclaimed
Alan.</p>

<p>“I guess it was because the idea was too
simple,” Buck said wisely.</p>

<p>Ned cut short further discussion.</p>

<p>“To work! To work, you fellows!” he cried.
“Remember that every instant wasted in chatter
carries us so much the nearer to earth where
there’s no telling what may await us.”</p>

<p>So thereupon all of the boys set to work with
a will. In their excitement they forgot the freezing
cold and their own discomfort. While Ned
kept the <em>Flyer</em> in its course, Bob and Alan and
Buck were working loose the screws which held
the heavy metal top plates in place and hammering
and prying with the razor-edged chisels. It
was far from being easy work, but they made
good headway for all that.</p>

<p>Presently Alan gave a triumphant shout and
tossed the first dislodged screw to the floor.
Others soon followed it. By that time Buck had
cut free the entire upper plate of metal from
the wooden box base on his side, and Bob had
pried it almost as loose on the other side. Soon<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
the whole thick sheet of metal came loose and
could be lifted free of its pedestal.</p>

<p>As Ned had surmised, its removal left fully
three-quarters of an inch of the broken end of
the lever protruding where it was easily possible
to get a grip on it with the heavy plyers.</p>

<p>Getting a firm grip on the shaft and pulling it
out were two entirely different matters, however,
as the boys soon found out. For a long time the
jammed lever resisted their every effort to
loosen it and faces again began to look grave.
It was not until they were almost ready to give
it up as a hopeless job, that, all of a sudden,
Buck, who was tugging with might and main,
felt the lever give slightly. A second later the
whole length slid smoothly up into view.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Alan, throwing his cap
wildly into the air. “Saved! saved! Now we
can get her under control again and laugh at
whoever may be waiting down there on Mother
Earth!”</p>

<p>The boys certainly were justified in performing
a war-dance of jubilation around the walls
of the little pilot house.</p>

<p>It only remained for them to repair the broken
handle, and then the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> was once more
responsive to the slightest touch of the hand<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
upon her delicate steering mechanism. Fully two
hours had elapsed; Alan’s watch showed nearly
eight o’clock.</p>

<p>As the airship continued to drop, the ice
melted on the port windows and a grateful
warmth began to make the blood circulate freely
again. The heavy overcoats were discarded and
everybody began talking excitedly about what
they were going to do when they reached the
earth once more. All agreed that, even if it
were only for a few minutes, they wanted to land
and feel good solid ground beneath their feet.</p>

<p>“But where do you suppose we’ll strike terra
firma?” asked Bob. “It’s pretty certain that
we won’t find ourselves over Belgium as when
we left.”</p>

<p>“What difference does it make anyhow?”
exulted Alan. “We’ll be on earth again, and
that’s enough of a guarantee for me just now.
I don’t care whether we land in Germany or
Japan.”</p>

<p>“Hold on there! It does make a difference
to me though,” cried Buck. “Remember that
the New York <cite>Herald</cite> really sent yours truly
along on this expedition as a war correspondent,
and I haven’t yet had a chance to write a word
of ‘copy’ or even to see a battle in progress. I<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
didn’t bring along all of those notebooks for
nothing, Alan!”</p>

<p>Everybody had to laugh heartily at that. Bob
agreed with Buck.</p>

<p>“I’m a newspaper man too, you know,” he
said, “and I also would like to see the actual
fighting at close range.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, old man,” rejoined Alan dryly,
“but I’ve seen quite enough fighting lately to
last me the rest of my natural life. However,
your words remind me that we haven’t yet heard
the story of your experiences in the war zone, or
how it was that the Germans came to arrest you
as a spy. Now that none of us have anything
much to do for a while, give us the yarn, won’t
you, Bob?”</p>

<p>Bob nodded, but before he could begin, Buck
cried:</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. Let’s all go up to the pilot
house where Ned can hear the story too.”</p>

<p>“That’s only right,” agreed Alan, so the
three of them rejoined Ned, where he sat at the
wheel, and Bob Russell related his adventures
as follows.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">BOB RUSSELL’S STORY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Shortly after international war was declared
last July, the <cite>Herald</cite> decided that it needed a
personal representative at the front, and I was
selected for the job because I had been over here
several times on pleasure trips before, knew the
lie of the land pretty well and moreover could
speak half a dozen languages. As you may
guess, I was mighty proud of being honored by
so responsible a position.</p>

<p>“Before leaving I called at the offices of the
Universal Transportation Company to bid Ned
and Alan good-bye, but found that they were
visiting their families in Chicago, and so had to
leave without seeing them.</p>

<p>“Following instructions, I landed first in England,
where I interviewed both Lord Roberts,
commander-in-chief of the British army, and Sir
Edward Grey, the prime minister. At that time
no one in London seemed to be much worried
over the war and it was prophesied that the
Kaiser would soon be treating for peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[135]</span></p>

<p>“Knowing the truly magnificent organization
of the German military machine as I did, I didn’t
think so, and really I don’t believe that gallant
Lord Roberts did either, despite his remarks in
our interview.</p>

<p>“I crossed the channel from Dover to Calais
on August fifteenth, shortly after the fall of
Liege and while sharp fighting was going on
between the Germans and French in Alsace-Lorraine.
Everything was in confusion. Train
service was disrupted, the French army was only
half mobilized yet, the Belgians, despite their
wonderful resistance, were being crushed by the
invading Germans on every hand, and the country
people were fleeing in abject terror to get
out of harm’s way.</p>

<p>“Contrary to expectations, I found that foreign
war correspondents were not at all welcome
and I was subjected to all sorts of petty annoyances
from both civic and military officials. It
was then that I began showing my neutral newspaper
credentials less frequently, and tried
wherever possible to pass myself off as a tourist
unable to return home.</p>

<p>“The allied French, Belgian and English
forces engaged the conquering German host all
along a two hundred and forty-eight mile battle<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
line on the Alsatian frontier about that time,
and the Germans threw millions of men into Belgium,
seeking a shortcut to already terrified
Paris. There were wild rumors afloat that Brussels,
the Belgium capital, would resist German
occupation. This promised to be a big ‘story’
for my paper, so I hurried there with what
haste I could.</p>

<p>“As you know, however, the terrible fate of
other Belgian cities which had resisted the invaders,
had pretty well cowed the citizens, and Brussels
surrendered without a shot being fired. I
was there when that wonderful German army
marched in and took possession, and I want to
tell you boys right now that it was the most
imposing spectacle I ever hope to see. The
crowds were packed eight and ten deep along
all the principal streets to watch the triumphal
entrance. They waited there anxiously from
early morning until two o’clock, when we heard
that the burgomaster had officially turned over
the keys of the city to the advance guard and
removed his scarf of office.</p>

<p>“‘They are coming! The Germans are here!’
ran through the tremendous throngs of citizens.</p>

<p>“On they came, preceded by a scouting party
of Uhlans, horse, foot, artillery and sappers,<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
with siege train complete. There were fully a
hundred armored motor cars on which rapid-firing
guns were mounted. Every regiment and
battery was headed by a band.</p>

<p>“Then came the drums and fifes, the blare of
brass and hoarse, lusty-voiced soldiers singing
‘Die Wacht am Rhein’ and ‘Deutschland Uber
Alles.’</p>

<p>“The legions of the war-king of Europe swept
down through the ancient streets of Brussels
like a great flood. But the gorgeous garb of the
German army was missing&mdash;the cherry-colored
and lilac uniforms of the horsemen, the bright
blue of the infantry. All wore greenish, earth-color
gray, which made them less conspicuous
for hostile marksmen. All of the spiked helmets
were painted gray. The gun carriages and even
the pontoon bridges were gray.</p>

<p>“To the quick-step rattle of drums, the Germans
marched to the city square. Then at a
sharp word of command, the gray-clad ranks,
like one grand machine, broke into the famous
stiff-legged ‘goose step,’ while the simple folk
of the town gazed with mouths agape. They did
this after a long, grueling night of continuous
marching, when we expected that they would be
staggering with fatigue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[138]</span></p>

<p>“There were the renowned 26th and 64th regiments,
already battle-scarred veterans. There
rode on prancing black horses the famous Brunswick
Death’s Head Hussars, and their comrades
on many bloody fields, the Zeiten Hussars. There
the dashing, reckless Uhlan lancers, some of
whom had Belgian officers manacled to their
stirrup leathers and caused a subdued murmur
of resentment to run through the crowd.
Instantly the German horsemen backed their
steeds into the densely packed ranks of the spectators,
threatening them with uplifted swords
and effectually quelling the outward manifestations
of momentary revolt.</p>

<p>“All day long and far into the night that
ominous gray column kept passing through the
streets, and it seemed for days afterwards as
if I could still hear the muffled <em>tramp, tramp,
tramp, tramp</em>, and the rumble of heavy gun
carriages over the cobblestones.</p>

<p>“The difficulties of my position were
immensely increased after this, for the Germans
proved very strict about signing passports or
letting noncombatants wander about the country.
While I was detained thus in Brussels,
reports came of the fall of Liege, fierce fighting
around Malines and the terrible sacking of<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
Louvain. The German hosts invaded France,
Rheims fell, the French government fled south
to Bordeaux, and it was commonly said that
the Germans would eat their Christmas dinner
in Paris.</p>

<p>“As you may guess, I was wild to get nearer
the battle front, but no efforts of mine could
persuade or bribe the German officers to let me
accompany the army on the march. About the
only news that I could cable back to the <cite>Herald</cite>
was made up of sketchy little sidelights on how
the Belgians lived under the conquerors, and
even those were grossly edited by the official
censor.</p>

<p>“Early in September we heard that the Allies
had rallied, however. The English had imported
Sepoys from India, and the French, black men
from Algeria to help them in fighting, and had
thrown themselves between trembling Paris and
the advancing Teuton. Then, on the 7th, I think
it was, came news that the German right wing
had been checked almost within cannon shot of
the French capital, and that the whole auxiliary
army of the Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm
had been hurled back by a masterly flank movement
on the part of the French under General
Joffre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[140]</span></p>

<p>“That seemed to be the turning point. Reinforcements
were daily arriving for the Allied
army from England and elsewhere; it was difficult
for the hard-pressed Germans to get sufficient
supplies so far from their own boundaries,
and, moreover, the Russian hordes had in the
meantime overrun all of East Prussia and had
become a dire menace there. A party of the
Army of the West was rushed across Germany
to help General Von Hindenburg resist the Russian
assault, and Von Kluck reluctantly fell
back from Paris to the French frontier, fighting
desperately every inch of the way.</p>

<p>“There the most sanguinary battles of the war
were fought as the Allies pressed on after the
retreating Germans. All of you boys have read
in the newspapers of the battles of the Meuse,
of the Marne, at Mons, and along that tremendous
battle line of the Aisne.</p>

<p>“Those terrible conflicts will go down in history
as the most awful of their kind ever known
on earth. The dead filled the trenches and river
bed so deep that they formed a solid footing for
their comrades to fight hand to hand with Englishman,
Frenchman, Hindu, Belgian, Algerian
and Lorrainer.</p>

<p>“Winter came with cold, ice, sleet and snow,<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
to intensify the sufferings of the inadequately
protected soldiers. Thousands of wounded died
from exposure on the field where they fell. They
fought on the earth, in tunnels under it, high up
in the air, on the sea and under the sea. They
mined the whole North Sea and the English
Channel. Antwerp surrendered and Ghent fell
before the Germans.</p>

<p>“And all of that time I was cooped up in one
Belgian town or another, stopped every time I
tried to get anywhere near the battle front, with
the <cite>Herald</cite> cabling me every day or so for some
<em>real</em> news&mdash;the stuff that they didn’t get through
Associated Press channels&mdash;‘copy’ that would
enable them to print something that everybody
else didn’t have.</p>

<p>“So finally I grew desperate and determined
to get closer to the scene of actual fighting, at no
matter what hazard. Right then my real troubles
began.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">HOW BOB WAS CAPTURED AS A SPY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“Now,” said Buck with a grin, “we are
about to get down to something that hasn’t been
printed forty times in the newspapers.”</p>

<p>Bob could not help getting a little huffy at
that.</p>

<p>“You’d be a mighty poor newspaper man,”
he said, “if you hadn’t heard something about
all of those things by this time. But of course if
you don’t want to hear the rest of this, why all
right.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Buck,” said Ned, himself smothering
a smile, for Bob was really funny when he
flared up in this way. “Go on with your story,
Bob, please. Of course we’re interested. You
were just going to tell us about what really
happened when you finally determined to take
matters into your own hands and go to the front,
whether the German authorities wanted you to
or not.”</p>

<p>Somewhat mollified, Bob continued his
narrative:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[143]</span></p>

<p>“I happened to be in Malines at the time and
the point where the heaviest fighting was going
on was in the Yser River district, a considerable
distance to the south. Nothing but military
trains were running between the two points and
naturally I wouldn’t have been permitted to take
one of them. My only remaining course was to
buy a horse and to take my chances of getting
there alone. It took me four days to buy that
horse and then I had to pay about four times
what he was worth, owing to the fact that the
cavalry had long before appropriated every
sound animal in the country.</p>

<p>“This noble charger of mine was wind-broken
and wall-eyed, those probably being the only reasons
why he had not been commandeered previously.
He was such an awful looking object
that I hated to be seen riding on him, but beggars
can’t be choosers and I had to make the
best of it.</p>

<p>“While staying there in Malines I had struck
up quite a friendly acquaintanceship with several
young officers, one of whom&mdash;Hoffmansthal by
name&mdash;was good enough to volunteer his services
in securing a passport for me from the commandant.
There was all sorts of red tape to be
gone through before I finally got it, and when I<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
did I found out that it was made out in the
name of ‘Philip Maestrich, citizen of Malines,
and by trade a silversmith.’ The papers went
on to say that I had been given official permission
to travel to Namur, not far from where the
fighting was, to the bedside of my sick wife.
My friend, Lieutenant Hoffmansthal, explained
that he could never have got the passport for me
except by this subterfuge.</p>

<p>“So I set out on my wobbly old mare and as
far as Corbais all went well. From there on
every patrol guarding the roads stopped me and
acknowledged the passport with extreme ill-grace.
I took to avoiding the main hotels in the
towns and slept in all sorts of unpleasant places&mdash;sometimes
even under a haystack out in the
open fields.</p>

<p>“Near Wasseige I found all of the roads
blockaded with reinforcements marching to the
front, and, rather than risk detection by them,
I made a wide détour to the east, turning south
again somewhere in the neighborhood of Villers
le Temple. That night a dreadful rainstorm
drove me to take shelter in a peasant’s cottage,
and he, while I slept, galloped on a plough-horse
to the nearest German outposts and won
a reward for declaring me a spy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[145]</span></p>

<p>“I was jerked roughly out of bed by a big,
red-bearded Uhlan captain, my saddlebags were
searched and even the linings cut out to discover
the presence of secret papers. There they
found my <cite>Herald</cite> credentials, which said that
my name was Robert Russell and not ‘Philip
Maestrich.’ That was enough with the blockhead
who had arrested me, and, all puffed up
with his capture, he sent me with a special detail
of men to Combret. Later I was transferred from
one camp to another until a hospital train happened
along bound for Muhlbruck. They bundled
me aboard this for trial by ferocious old
General Haberkampf, whose field headquarters
were located at our destination.</p>

<p>“Never will I forget the ghastly horrors of
that five-hour ride on that hospital train. The
engine barely crawled along, bumping over rails
which the Belgians had torn up in the early
days of the war, and which had subsequently
been re-laid by the Germans. Every railway
coach was packed to suffocation with wounded,
some of them so frightfully mangled as to
appear scarcely human any longer.</p>

<p>“Groans and piteous cries for water or more
air echoed in my ears both day and night. Each
morning we stopped to put out three or four<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
poor fellows who had died overnight. Some
were delirious with pain and would scream, sing
or curse frantically, defying the Red Cross
nurses to come near them. The smell of blood,
ether and arnica made the air sickening. I
myself was wholly unnerved by it, but my
soldier guards maintained the appearance of
stolid indifference. Perhaps they had become
used to seeing such suffering as that.</p>

<p>“Finally we arrived in Muhlbruck. I was
completely fagged out by then, and really scarcely
cared whether they shot me or not. My brain
was numb with the horrors with which I had
been surrounded. I couldn’t think, let alone
invent a story that would plausibly account for
my traveling about under an assumed name.</p>

<p>“When they hauled me up before old General
Haberkampf, he hardly gave me a chance to
defend myself. He is a soldier of the old, hard
school of the Emperor Wilhelm I&mdash;the sort of
fellow who makes militarism his god.</p>

<p>“‘In other words,’ he growled at me, ‘you
confess that you are not the person whose passport
you use, and that you have for some time
past been penetrating our lines under false
colors. You now say that you are an American
newspaper man, yet you know that war correspondents<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
have been officially ordered out of the
war zone. How do I know but that you are
lying to me as you already have to all of my
officers between here and Malines? You are a
spy!’</p>

<p>“I tried to bring him into a reasonable frame
of mind, but that is a hard thing to do with a
man whose army is being daily beaten further
back. He would not listen to me.</p>

<p>“Then they took me to a foul prison where
I stayed for three weeks with about fifty other
wretched men&mdash;some of them Frenchmen who
had been captured in battle; a couple of them
peasants who had been caught looting dead
bodies on the battle field; and three or four
common malefactors. We were treated well
enough there, but sanitary conditions were
unspeakable, and, really, the news of yesterday
that my case was at last to come up for final
decision, struck me as an actual relief.</p>

<p>“Long before this I had given up all hopes
of ever escaping and I expected to be condemned.
My trial was a mere form. All the way down
that road to the place of execution this morning
I kept thinking about you boys, wondering what
you were doing and if you would have tried to
rescue me had you heard of my plight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[148]</span></p>

<p>“All of the adventures and happy times we
ever had together in the past recurred to me
vividly. Good old pals! How I wanted to see
you just once more before I died!</p>

<p>“When they backed me up against that wall,
I closed my eyes, expecting to hear the death
volley ring out at any moment. Then I suddenly
felt something tugging and slashing at my
wrists, the hard ropes fell away, and I turned,
half-dazed, to find Buck shoving two big revolvers
into my hands, with word that you other
boys were near with the <em>Flyer</em>.</p>

<p>“You know the rest of the story, and I can’t
say anything more except that words don’t suffice
to express my opinion of the perfectly bully
way you have acted towards me.”</p>

<p>“Land! Land!” shouted Ned just then. “I
can see the trees down below!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A STRANGE COUNTRY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The shout of the lookout on Columbus’ ship
when he first sighted the New World created no
greater excitement than did Ned’s words among
the boys on the <em>Ocean Flyer</em>. Each and every
one of them rushed to the port windows with
binoculars through which to scan the view more
closely.</p>

<p>The scene was, however, most disappointing.
As far as the eye could reach below stretched an
expanse of sparsely-wooded uninviting plain,
with white patches of snow still showing upon
it. Far off to the southwest the peaks of a
mighty range of rugged mountains loomed
hazily. Not a bird flew in the sky; not a human
habitation was to be seen. Away to the northwest
a narrow ribbon of something gray was
twisting slowly across the country. Little points
of light flickered above it where the sunbeams
struck.</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked Alan, pointing out
the snake-like thing. “Is it a river?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>“No, I don’t think so,” answered Buck.
“Ned, let’s get nearer to that thing and see just
what it is.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the course of the <em>Flyer</em> was
altered and, flying at an elevation of about 1,100
feet above the ground, she rapidly drew near the
mysterious object.</p>

<p>Closer approach gave the boys a genuine surprise.
The “snake” proved to be five battalions
of soldiery on the march&mdash;infantry,
cavalry and artillery. There seemed to be thousands
and thousands of them&mdash;more men than
any of the boys had ever seen gathered together
before. The uniforms were of a dark blue.
Some of the regiments wore little round caps of
the same color, set rakishly on one side of their
heads; others wore huge flat fur or wool hats.
Most of the soldiers seemed to be unusually
large and rough looking. The majority of them
were bearded.</p>

<p>“Russians!” exclaimed Bob. “See those
flags! Russians on the way to reinforce either
the army invading Austria or their comrades
fighting the Germans in East Prussia is what
they are!”</p>

<p>The appearance of the big airship caused the
greatest confusion in the ranks. The cavalry<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
galloped wildly this way and that; infantrymen
broke their regular marching formation to scatter
and fire their guns futilely at it; the cannon
were hurriedly unlimbered and efforts made to
elevate their muzzles which would bring the
<em>Flyer</em> within range.</p>

<p>The young aeronauts could not help laughing
at the disorder their approach caused, and agreed
with Ned that it was better not to get too close
to the Russians. So the airship was raised to
a greater altitude and took a southwesterly
course.</p>

<p>“Why this particular direction?” queried
Alan. “We have no idea where we are except
that it is Russian territory, which may mean
Siberia or Lapland.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ned, “we want to get back to
the seat of war, and it’s a pretty safe bet that
those Russians are bound for there by the shortest
possible route. They are headed in a southwesterly
direction, so it stands to reason that if
we follow the same course, we’ll arrive somewhere
near their destination.”</p>

<p>This was a logical deduction, so the <em>Flyer</em> was
held to that position, and all sight of the army
was soon lost in their rear.</p>

<p>For perhaps three hours the character of the<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
underlying landscape remained the same as when
it first was sighted. After that it gradually
began to vary, assuming a more rolling aspect,
with considerable stretches of forestland. Indications
of snow became less frequent; cultivated
fields began to appear here and there, then little
villages and finally a large city. Several towns
of considerable size were passed over, but the
airship was flying at too great an altitude for
the boys to see much of them or to locate more
exactly where they were.</p>

<p>By this time the sun was sinking, and there
was danger of the <em>Flyer’s</em> passing completely
over and beyond the “theater of war” in the
darkness. Alan and Bob counseled a descent to
earth for the night. This seemed to be a pretty
safe procedure, as the vessel could be got under
way again within a few minutes should any
unexpected need arise, and it would, further,
give the weary young aeronauts a chance to
stretch their limbs and inhale some fresh air.</p>

<p>After a short discussion it was decided to do
this. Sweeping in a diminishing spiral downward,
the boys sighted a little village nestled
snugly in a valley. The smoke from fires where
goodwives were cooking the evening meal, arose
in delicate streams in the calm air. Here and<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
there a light already twinkled in a cottage window.
Peasants were just driving the lowing
cattle home for milking.</p>

<p>“Let’s land over there!” exclaimed Buck.
“I’m fairly hungry for the sight of somebody
who won’t shoot before asking who you are, and,
aside from that, I’ll bet that these simple folk
would be willing to set us up a regular homelike
meal!”</p>

<p>“How do you know that they won’t shoot at
us, Buck?” asked Alan.</p>

<p>“I guess that we’re pretty safe on that score,”
Bob broke in. “These people are evidently
honest countrymen who’ll be far more afraid of
us than we need be of them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and besides,” added Buck, “we can
find out from them just where we are and how
near we are to the battle front.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good point,” Ned said, “but
they’re probably Russians or Poles, and they
wouldn’t understand what we wanted to know.
None of us speak their outlandish language.”</p>

<p>“I know a little Russian&mdash;at least enough for
our needs,” volunteered Bob. “If you boys
think that it’s safe to make a landing, I’ll guarantee
to do all interpreting.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” chorused the others, and so the landing<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
was made in the meadows within a stone’s
throw of the first cottages.</p>

<p>There was, of course, immediate excitement
throughout the town. The rusty bell in the
steeple of the weather-beaten old church pealed
an alarm, lights were immediately extinguished,
and everybody came rushing out from their
house-doors. At sight of the monster airship
settling down there in the pasture with the
blood-red rays of the sunset turning her metal
body into the seeming of molten steel, a genuine
panic ensued.</p>

<p>The women and children fled within, slamming
and barring their doors behind them. The male
villagers hastily caught up the first objects of
defense that came to hand&mdash;flails, pitchforks,
scythes, an old-fashioned muzzle-loading musket
or two. They huddled together like so many
frightened sheep in front of the town church,
uncertain whether to fly or fight.</p>

<p>“Look!” called Buck. “We’re frightening
these poor people to death. Show a white flag,
some of you, and show them that we mean to
be friendly.”</p>

<p>Alan complied by jumping down from the
lower runway, waving a flag of truce, and both
Buck and Bob followed him, holding their empty<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
hands high in the air to show that they were
unarmed. The trio walked slowly straight
towards the group of peasants, while Ned
remained on one of the outer galleries of the
<em>Flyer</em>, rifle in hand, ready to defend them if
need be.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed, good people!” shouted
Bob in Russian. “We don’t intend to harm
you. All that we want is a good square meal, a
chance to walk around a bit, and a little information
as to our whereabouts.”</p>

<p>Although their suspicions were not altogether
allayed, the peasants showed immediate relief,
and three, who seemed to be the ringleaders,
advanced hesitatingly to meet the approaching
boys.</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gott gruessen Ihr, Gefremde</i>,” (God bless
you, strangers) said one of them, extending his
right hand.</p>

<p>“Holy smoke! Did you hear that, boys? He’s
addressing us in <em>German</em>,” cried Bob and Buck
together. “This is better than we looked for,
but surely we can’t be back in Germany!”</p>

<p>Everybody shook hands solemnly all around,
and Bob explained to the villagers.</p>

<p>“We are American newspaper men, over here
to gather war news and find photographs for our<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
papers,” said he. “We had an accident yesterday
and lost our way, and now are simply
looking for a chance to rest a little before going
on.”</p>

<p>“You are all welcome to do that here,” said
the spokesman for the villagers with true Teutonic
hospitality. “We shall be glad to have
you eat with us. In return you can tell us about
the great war.”</p>

<p>“We certainly will take you up on that,”
cried Buck, and led the way back to the airship
to tell Ned of their cordial reception. All of
the villagers&mdash;the women and round-eyed children
too&mdash;crowded gaping around the strange
aircraft with exclamations of wonder.</p>

<p>“I guess it will be safe for us to leave the
<em>Flyer</em> here unguarded,” said Ned. “These people
don’t act as if they would tamper with it,
and I want to get in on those ‘eats’ too. Anyway,
we won’t have to go very far away, and
can get back here in a jiffy if we have to.”</p>

<p>All of the boys agreed to this and so it was
settled. Before leaving the ship, to accompany
the villagers, they all secretly slipped revolvers
into their coat pockets. As Bob said:</p>

<p>“It’s always better to be on the safe side.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">A FIGHT WITH WILD COSSACKS IN POLAND</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The leader of the villagers escorted his young
guests to the largest house in the town, where
immediate preparations were made for the finest
dinner that German housewives&mdash;and there are
no better!&mdash;could make. All of the townspeople
who could crowd into the room did so, and
both windows and the doorway were jammed
with the curious faces of others who wanted to
hear news of the Great War.</p>

<p>There were not stools enough to go around, so
they all sat cross-legged on the floor and talked
as they ate.</p>

<p>“First of all,” said Bob, “what is this place
called and in what country is it?”</p>

<p>The question struck the simple villagers as
being very funny and they all laughed
uproariously.</p>

<p>“You will have to excuse us,” smiled the
spokesman, “but we supposed that everybody
had heard of Kolwinsk, which is the name of our
town. You are now in East Prussia, about<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
twenty miles over the boundary from Poland,
and perhaps thirty or thirty-five miles from
where the nearest fighting is going on. Lying
this far to the northwest, we are out of the line
of invasion and so far have been lucky enough
to escape Russian raiding parties about which
such terrible stories are told. They say that
the Cossack horsemen have perpetrated the most
inhuman atrocities. No village through which
they pass is left unpillaged. They butcher or
torture the aged in cold-blood, dash out the
brains of babies against tree-trunks, and reduce
the screaming, helpless women to worse than
shame. If they resist, the Cossacks mutilate
them in awful fashion.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can hardly believe all that,” interposed
Alan. “The Russians are civilized people.”</p>

<p>“Maybe so,” replied the village head-man
with some heat, “but remember the old saying:
‘Scratch a Russian and you’ll find the Tartar
underneath.’ This war has made brutish beasts
of everyone taking part in it. Also remember
that this Russian army is made up not only of
full-blooded Russians, but also of Baltic Province
men, Jews from Riga and Libau, huge,
hairy Siberians, barbarous Circassians and Kalmuck
Tartars, who are half Chinese&mdash;as mongrel<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>
and savage a horde as ever devastated a
Christian country. But, of them all, the wild
Cossack from the steppes is the worst and most
to be dreaded. He knows no religion, no law,
no pity, and couples with that a daring which
even our own gallant Uhlans cannot surpass.”</p>

<p>Ned tried to get the German to change the
subject, for he was working himself into a frenzy.</p>

<p>“How has the war progressed here in the
east?” he asked. “We Americans, you know,
have been watching the western struggle more
closely.”</p>

<p>The village spokesman shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Here it has been now in favor of the Germans,
now with the Russians. At first General
Rennenkampf led millions after millions of his
wild men swarming into Poland. We had too
few men on the frontier to resist and so were
beaten back. Then the Kaiser sent us General
Von Hindenburg, a hero who won the Iron Cross
for distinguished services when we captured
Paris in the time of the present Emperor’s
father. Von Hindenburg is of the old hard
school, but he is a great commander. He rallied
our troops and in turn pressed the Russians
back. He lured Rennenkampf into a trap at
Tannenberg and nearly annihilated the whole<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
Russian army. Then the Grand Duke Nicholas
arrived from Petrograd with millions more Russians.
The struggle seesawed back and forth all
of the way from Angerburg to Gumbinnen and
between the Warthe and the Vistula. We lost a
big battle before Warsaw in Poland, lost again
at Lodz, and then won on the same battlefield,
and again at Lowicz, in which two engagements
we captured over 120,000 prisoners. So it is
going on even now. We are still fighting hand
to hand with the Russians around Warsaw; and
Lowicz, which was ours yesterday, may be theirs
to-morrow. Our army is holding eight times
their number of Russians in check, and that’s
enough to be proud of.”</p>

<p>“But what about the Austrians? Haven’t
they helped any here in combating the Russian
invasion?” asked Bob.</p>

<p>“No, the Austrians have had quite enough to
do protecting themselves at home, and have left
Germany to fight the whole world single-handed.
The Austrians invaded Servia six months ago,
captured Belgrade, the capital, and then were
driven out of the country altogether. Now the
Serbs and Montenegrins are themselves invading
Austria in the south and east, while the Russians
have completely overrun Galicia and Transylvania.<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
No, Austria has been of no real help
to Germany in this war.</p>

<p>“But you, sir, were going to tell us about
what has been going on in the west. Who is
winning there now?”</p>

<p>So Bob and Buck, both of whom spoke German
with fair fluency, went on to outline the operations
in France and Belgium. They were still
in the midst of this when all at once there came
a noise as if bedlam had broken loose on the
other side of the village.</p>

<p>The thunder of furiously galloping horses
filled the air. Then came fusillade and fusillade
of shots and hideous demoniacal yells, with which
were intermingled the shrieks of terrified women
and children and the clang of the alarm bell.</p>

<p>“Help! Help! Ah, help! The Cossacks are
upon us!”</p>

<p>Everybody gathered in the big room leaped
to their feet. Terror seemed fairly to paralyze
the peasants. Some few seized clubs or knives
to defend themselves, but most ran aimlessly
about wringing their hands and calling upon
heaven to save them. Those men having wives
and children at home unprotected, rushed forth
into the street directly into the path of the wild
riders from the steppes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[162]</span></p>

<p>The boys dashed for the door at the first warning,
but the raiders were thundering down the
street almost upon them. There were perhaps
sixty Cossacks all told&mdash;barbarous looking,
swarthy fellows with flying long black hair and
sheepskin jackets. Their beards were a-bristle;
their eyes rolled red and wickedly; they brandished
curved Mongolian swords or shot to right
and left with sawed-off carbines pressed against
their thighs. The shaggy, under-sized ponies
were as wild-looking as their worse than savage
masters.</p>

<p>Seeing them come galloping pellmell not a
stone’s throw away, the boys dodged inside the
house again, barely escaping a random volley
which was fired at the cottage as the horsemen
swept past. In a few minutes they had overrun
the whole village, and the horrid noise of the
slaughter was half drowned in shrill, uncouth
Siberian yells and the roar of flames from houses
which had been ruthlessly set on fire.</p>

<p>The glare of the burning hut across the street
shone weirdly through the doorway, making the
boys’ faces look ghastly. The rolling clouds of
smoke half choked them and smarted their eyes.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get out of here&mdash;<em>quick</em>!”
gasped Ned. “Those fellows may discover the<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
<em>Ocean Flyer</em> at any moment, and there’s no telling
what may happen then. Follow me and
have your weapons ready!”</p>

<p>Straight out into the street they plunged and
found themselves in the midst of a scene more
frightful than words can adequately describe.
Half of the village was already ablaze, the
thatched roofs of the cottages spurting yellow
flames high up into the air and giving off an
intolerable heat. The scene was almost as light
as day. Silhouetted against the lurid glare, wild
Cossacks were cutting down the fear-crazed
peasants.</p>

<p>One fleeing woman with a babe in her arms
was caught by her unbound hair and dragged
screaming to her knees. As her frantic husband
leaped at her assailant, the Cossack shot him
deliberately through the heart. The dead lay
fallen in grotesque postures half out of doorways
or huddled bleeding on the street. Here
and there a wounded man was crawling away
to die in the fields.</p>

<p>Crack! Crack! Crack! sounded the revolvers
of the intrepid boys as they charged down the
street. Shot for shot answered them from the
surprised marauders, who had not expected
quarry like this. They leaped upon their prancing<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
ponies again and tried to ride down these
determined opponents, but, sheltered behind a
yet unburnt hut, the boys met them with so
withering a fire that they galloped on past.</p>

<p>“Run!” yelled Buck. “It’s our only
chance!”</p>

<p>The boys did. It was heart-breaking work,
but they arrived unwounded at the side of the
<em>Flyer</em>. As they bounded up the hanging rope-ladder,
their pursuers galloped madly up behind
them. Shots rattled against the metal hull of the
airship like hail against a window-pane, and half
a dozen wild fellows tried to follow their escaping
prey up the ladder before it could be drawn
in.</p>

<p>It was a matter of seconds, but just in time
the ladder was jerked out of the reach of clutching
hands.</p>

<p>“All ready there, Mr. Engineer,” shouted
Buck from up above the pilot room.</p>

<p>Buck made a dash for his post, the current
was turned on, and in a minute more the <em>Flyer</em>
was soaring high above the scene of the massacre.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">INSIDE OF BESIEGED PRZEMYSL</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“The fiends!” exclaimed Alan, staring horrified
down upon the heap of blazing ruins which
so short a time before had been happy, peaceful
homes. “It would be only right if we were to
drop a few lyddite bombs down upon them!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Bob, “we mustn’t do that, because
we would be almost certain to blow up a good
many of those poor German villagers along with
the guilty Cossacks.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe that there are any Germans
left alive there,” grumbled Alan.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, we shouldn’t bombard the Russians,”
interposed Ned. “Remember, Alan, that
we aren’t in Europe either to fight or take sides
in any way, unless we absolutely have to in order
to protect our own lives. The United States is
a neutral country, and we must do nothing
which might later imperil that neutrality. I
know that it’s hard to spare such wretches as
those we have just escaped, but we ought to do
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[166]</span></p>

<p>“Ned is right,” chimed in both Bob and Buck,
so Alan had to forego the bomb-dropping, richly
as the Cossacks deserved it.</p>

<p>“Well, where to now?” asked Ned, when the
<em>Flyer</em> had continued on her course in a westerly
direction for about ten minutes. “Shall we head
for Russian Poland and see what General
Von Hindenburg is doing towards capturing
Warsaw?”</p>

<p>“Don’t go there because you may think that
I want to,” replied Bob. “I’m sick of the way
they fight here on the eastern frontier. They
may kill more men in Belgium with their big
cannon, but at least they do it in a soldierly
fashion.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather go somewhere else too,” said
Alan. “How about a flight to Asia Minor? I
read in the papers just before we left America
that the Allied fleets were knocking the Turkish
forts on the Dardanelles to pieces with thirteen-inch
guns. That might be an interesting
sight.”</p>

<p>“No, let’s not go there,” Bob objected. “Let
poor little Turkey die alone. She had no business
getting mixed up in this war in the first
place. We’ll pass up the scrap there and the
Japanese assault on Tsing-Tau. As far as I’m<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
concerned there’s only one place more I’d like
to see before we start for New York again, and
that is Przemysl.</p>

<p>“You know that it is one of the great strategic
fortifications in Galicia, and was the first
real stumbling-block in the way of the Russian
invasion of Austria-Hungary. When the Austrian
army was crushed at Jaroslaw and
retreated in disorder to protect Budapest, they
asked for volunteers to garrison Przemysl. It
was pointed out at that time that the town and
fortress would surely be besieged, and that there
was very little hope of any Austrians remaining
ever escaping with his life. The orders were to
hold out at no matter what sacrifices.</p>

<p>“Volunteers came forward a plenty. Then
millions of Russians poured down around the
city. These burned the town, shelled the citadel
and tried actual assault. All in vain! So the
Russians left three army corps of men besieging
the fortress and marched on to the conquest
of Hungary. Those besiegers are still camped
around the brave fellows in Przemysl. Six
months and more of famine rations, terrible
disease and unceasing bombardment have not
quenched their determination to hold out until
the last man drops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[168]</span></p>

<p>“Now, don’t you boys agree with me that a
visit to Przemysl ought to prove worth while?”</p>

<p>“Przemysl it is then,” cried Ned. “You’re
a wonderful speech-maker, Bob.”</p>

<p>“Quit your kidding,” grinned the newspaper
man. “Also, if you really want to reach Przemysl,
I’d advise you to ship our course more to
the southeast.”</p>

<p>“Aye, aye, sir!” grinned Ned, with a mock-serious
salute. “Sou’ by sou’east it is, sir!”</p>

<p>“Humph!” grunted Bob. “I hope that Buck
Stewart has our breakfast ready.”</p>

<p>The jagged summits of the Carpathians&mdash;mountains
more rugged and awe-inspiring than
those of Switzerland itself&mdash;scalloped the southern
horizon and seemed to overshadow the countryside
for leagues, when Ned announced from
the pilot-room that Przemysl was in sight.</p>

<p>For an hour past they had been traversing a
region of wild grandeur, where broad rivers
rushed tumbling and foaming down from the
rocky heights, where wild sheep browsed on
lonely hillsides and where the binoculars showed
natives as fantastically garbed as the bandit
chorus of a popular musical comedy.</p>

<p>They had seen whole brigades of Russians on
the march, plodding sullenly along like slaves<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
under the driver’s whip. They had seen signal
fires leap flaming from hill crest to mountain
crag. They had seen a flotilla of Russian barges
being poled down the broad, glistening waters of
the Vistula, an ugly, snub-nosed cannon on every
boat. They had seen the remnants of a once
natty Austrian regiment being hunted down and
shot like rabbits by mounted Cossacks. All this
they had seen and much more.</p>

<p>Away off to the west the dull rumble and muttering
of heavy cannonading vibrated through
the air. That was the battle of Cracow in
progress, although the boys did not know it then.</p>

<p>Death and devastation was everywhere.
Smouldering villages with unburied bodies among
the embers lay in the track of each army,
whether Serb, Russian or Austrian.</p>

<p>“Przemysl is directly ahead!” called Ned
down through the speaking tube, and the <em>Ocean
Flyer</em> began to plane slowly towards it.</p>

<p>The shell-battered citadel stood upon a little
rise of ground with the ashes and fire-charred
walls of what had been the flourishing town
surrounding it. The tattered red, white and
green flag of the dual empire still flapped defiantly
upon the walls. All around the fortress,
for miles and miles, stretched the vast encampment<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
of the great horde of Russian besiegers.</p>

<p>They had dug a zigzag line of shallow trenches
as close to the walls as they dared, and sharp-shooters
lay flat on their stomachs in these,
watching for an incautious head above the battlements.
Every now and then a little puff of
bluish smoke somewhere along the line showed
the alertness of the marksmen.</p>

<p>Some distance farther back three batteries of
artillery had been planted behind earthworks
and these every now and then belched forth
fire, shaking the ground as their shells went
hurtling towards the obstinate defenders.</p>

<p>As always before, the appearance of the
<em>Ocean Flyer</em> created an instantaneous disturbance
among all who saw it. Aerial guns were
trained upon it from both the fortress and the
Russian lines, and several smaller military aeroplanes
shot bird-like into the sky to reconnoitre
it.</p>

<p>The first of these rose directly from Przemysl
itself and Alan signaled to it from one of the
<em>Flyer’s</em> outside runways by waving a white flag.
The Austrian aviator swung near enough for
Bob to explain that their mission was peaceful
and that they wanted to alight inside the walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[171]</span></p>

<p>“Wait until I report concerning you,” called
back the Austrian.</p>

<p>He volplaned down into the city and returned
with the message that the <em>Flyer</em> would be permitted
to descend.</p>

<p>It seemed as if every man in the garrison not
on guard duty gathered to see the big airship as
it settled down upon the parade ground, and the
commandant himself was there to meet his unusual
visitors. After learning their identity, he
greeted the boys cordially, but said:</p>

<p>“I confess that I am disappointed too, because
the general outline of your vessel suggested to
me that it might be a new form of German
dirigible, come with news of a relief army on
the way. You have heard, of course, of the great
fleet of Zeppelins which they are getting ready
for the aerial invasion of England?”</p>

<p>“We have heard rumors of something like
that,” answered Alan, “but were inclined to
believe that it was all just a bugaboo to frighten
London.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Not at all,” the commandant
assured him warmly. “You will see in the
course of the next few weeks. Yes, and England
shall see too!”</p>

<p>After that the young aeronauts were shown<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
over the fortress, which really was a small town
in itself. Many of the buildings had been set
afire or demolished by bursting shells, but a
corps of engineers was kept ready at all times
to repair damages as fast as they were made.</p>

<p>Food supplies had run short some time before
and the garrison was then reduced to starvation
rations, consisting of a little soup with a few
crumbs of black bread and, twice a week, a bit
of tinned meats. Horses and even rats had been
eaten with relish. The soldiers presented a
pathetic but inspiring spectacle. The hospitals
were crowded with sick and wounded; the walls
were gradually crumbling under incessant shell
fire, yet that garrison of heroes remained
undaunted.</p>

<p>It was as Buck said, “just as if they had been
Americans.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE BOYS PERFORM AN ACT OF MERCY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The Austrian commandant’s story of the
frightful privations which his garrison had
undergone, stirred all four of the boys deeply.
Buck took Ned to one side and said:</p>

<p>“Did you note all of the awful things that
the governor there says these poor chaps have
had to eat?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you say to inviting him on
the sly to have one little square meal with us
aboard the <em>Flyer</em> before we leave? Just leave
it to me to make it a Jim dandy! I’d like to
feed the whole lot of them if only we had the
victuals.”</p>

<p>“Let’s ask the commandant if he will accept,”
said Ned, brightening.</p>

<p>The Austrian listened gravely to their well-meant
offer, but the boys could feel him
stiffening.</p>

<p>“You forget, gentlemen, that whatever hardships
the soldier of the dual monarchy may<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
have to suffer, his officers are proud to endure
with him. I thank you for your courtesy, but
cannot honorably accept it.”</p>

<p>Many pitiful sights were seen by the Airship
Boys on their tour of the fortress, but none
impressed them more deeply than that of a
young man in one of the hospital wards. He
was wasted to mere skin and bones with fever
which flamed insanely in his eyes. His feet
they had swathed in great layers of bandages, at
the ends of which wooden splints protruded.
All the time in his delirium he would keep
whispering in the most heart-rending accents:</p>

<p>“Ah, Liebchen, dich kann ich nicht mehr
gruessen!”</p>

<p>“What is that he keeps saying?” asked Alan
of their guide.</p>

<p>“He is speaking of his young bride in
Vienna&mdash;bemoaning the fact that he may never
see her again. Lieutenant Racoszky here came
of a comparatively poor middle-class family
but fell in love with the heiress of Count
Polnychek, one of the most influential noblemen
of Budapest, and the head of one of the oldest
families in Hungary. The girl was a reigning
beauty of the fashionable set, but that did not
keep her from falling in love with Racoszky here.<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
He was handsome, gay, dashing, in those days
before the war. So they were married secretly.</p>

<p>“By and by the old Count found out about
it and would not permit Racoszky to see his girl-wife
any more. Then she eloped one night and
they fled together. They settled in a little town
not far from Budapest and were happy. And
one day she told Racoszky that she was about to
bear him a child.</p>

<p>“That was one week after war had been
declared. Already the Serbs were across our
borders and Montenegro was daily threatening to
join them. The war office was in a panic. All
available troops were rushed to the southern
frontier, where we were defeated badly. A
second army was sent and it too met with
reverses. Then the Russians began to cross our
northeastern frontier by the millions. Every
able-bodied man in the land was drafted.</p>

<p>“Racoszky here hoped to escape until after
his child was born, but that he was not permitted
to do. It was the hard-hearted old count, her
father, who himself told the recruiting officers
that Racoszky was a coward and was trying
to avoid his duty. So one day they came and
seized him in the market place as he was coming
out of the doctor’s office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[176]</span></p>

<p>“‘Come with us. You are called to the
colors!’ they told him sternly.</p>

<p>“Racoszky was desperate. He tried to plead
off.</p>

<p>“‘Good sirs,’ he pleaded, ‘I am but now come
to hasten a doctor to the bedside of my wife.
See, he is running there now. Let me at least
wait until the crisis is past.’</p>

<p>“‘No!’ growled the recruiting sergeant
roughly. ‘We have heard all about you and
your trickiness. Come along now before we
make you.’</p>

<p>“Then Racoszky became like a madman. He
tried to break away from them and run back to
his suffering wife. All in vain. They clubbed
him insensible with their pistol butts, handcuffed
him and took him away to Koloszvar,
where the regiments were forming. For whole
weeks thereafter he remained like one distraught.
It was then that I first met him and learned the
story. Finally a sort of dreadful calm came over
him. He no longer raved nor wept nor tried to
escape. His face lost all expression and he went
methodically about his work like a person in a
trance.</p>

<p>“Word had come that his old enemy, the
count, had gone for his daughter and taken her<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
away with him down the Danube to Vienna. All
of the idle rich fled there when they saw there
was really danger that the invading foe might
overrun all Hungary.</p>

<p>“Poor Racoszky never has heard from his
girl-wife since then. He never spoke of her to
any of us until the delirium of this fever began
to rack him. He became a terrible fighter. His
ferocity in hand-to-hand combats with the Russians
was appalling even to us who fought
shoulder to shoulder with him. He was that way
at Slovno, on the blood-soaked field of Lemberg,
at Doukle in Galicia, where our great retreat
first began.</p>

<p>“Then we came here to Przemysl, and
Racoszky was among the first to volunteer to be
one of the garrison which everybody agreed was
doomed to certain death. I said to him at that
time:</p>

<p>“‘Racoszky, my friend, why do you not go
on with the main army? They are falling back
upon Vienna, and there maybe you might see
your cherished wife again.’</p>

<p>“He gave me so terrible a look that I never
have dared mention the subject to him again.</p>

<p>“After that the army marched away and left
us to our fate. Then came the Russian hordes,<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
until the whole plain was black with them.
They assaulted, they bombarded, they dug
mines, and blood ran as freely as water. We
beat them back. So then they camped all around
us here like so many of their own Siberian
wolves, waiting until the poor dog dropped from
hunger and they could rend him limb from limb.</p>

<p>“We of the garrison all suffered cheerfully
together. There was very little grumbling. The
commandant’s hair turned white when we served
up the roast flesh of his favorite charger as a
delicacy on his birthday.</p>

<p>“Two weeks ago it seemed as if we all were
about to starve at last. Only our spirits
remained strong. Racoszky came forward and
volunteered to lead a sortie out into the enemy’s
camp if twenty men would follow him. He
promised to bring back food, and did, but he
came back with his legs riddled with bullets. All
but two of them who accompanied him fell
somewhere outside there.</p>

<p>“Long before this we had run out of all adequate
medical supplies. Our surgeons could not
probe Racoszky’s legs properly to remove but
one of the three bullets which had lodged there.
They wanted to amputate, but he swore that he
would kill himself if they did. So there he has<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
lain ever since, poor fellow, with his wounds
festering, and blood poison getting more assured
every day. Always he keeps moaning in that
way for his girl-bride and the baby he has
never seen.”</p>

<p>This touching story moved all of the boys
profoundly and weighed on their spirits to such
an extent that Alan finally said:</p>

<p>“What do you fellows say to playing the Good
Samaritan and taking Lieutenant Racoszky out of
here in the <em>Flyer</em> to some place where he can
get the medical attention that his bravery
deserves?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I was thinking,” answered
Bob.</p>

<p>“And I,” echoed Buck. “But where shall
we take him?”</p>

<p>Ned spoke up.</p>

<p>“Why not to Vienna, the capital? The very
best hospitals and surgeons in the country are
there and&mdash;so are his wife and baby. The sight
of them would undoubtedly do him as much good
as all of the expert medical attention he would
receive.”</p>

<p>“The very thing! A great idea!” exclaimed
the other boys. “But what about that crabbed
old count, her father! Do you think that he<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
will relent enough to permit Racoszky to see
his daughter?”</p>

<p>“That,” said Ned briefly, “is up to us and
can, I think, be managed. Anyway, it certainly
is worth the trial. Now let’s go to the commandant
and see if he will permit us to remove
the lieutenant.”</p>

<p>The governor, they found, was only too pleased
to afford his faithful officer this unexpected
chance of recovery, and helped remove the invalid
to a soft bed they had made ready in the airship’s
spare stateroom.</p>

<p>“By nightfall we shall have him in competent
hands there in Vienna,” said Ned, already at the
wheel.</p>

<p>“Good luck and tell them there in the capital
that Przemysl still holds out,” called the
commandant.</p>

<p>“No fear that we won’t do that!” the boys
cried, and, amid the increasing whir and roar
of the powerful propellers, the <em>Ocean Flyer</em>
once more swept up into the sky and out over
the great plain where the Russian encampment
lay.</p>

<p>Buck threw a large, black, pear-shaped object
overboard and down at the crowd below waving
good-byes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[181]</span></p>

<p>“Great heavens, what was that? A bomb?”
exclaimed Bob, startled.</p>

<p>“No,” Buck replied solemnly, “that was a
smoked ham&mdash;our last one, too.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">STRANGE SIGHTS IN VIENNA</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The course of the <em>Flyer</em> to the Austro-Hungarian
capital was southeasterly, and it was
already dusk by the time the vicinity was
reached. Had it only been lighter the boys might
have been treated to a magnificent view of the
outlying ranges of the Alps directly in front
of them, with the ancient historic city lying
there below on the right bank of the lordly
Danube.</p>

<p>Their approach had, however, been seen, and
long before they reached the city ten or twelve
military aeroplanes were hovering excitedly
about them. According to directions given by
the commandant at Przemysl, the boys hung out
two flags&mdash;one German, the other Austrian&mdash;and,
encouraged by the sight of these, one aviator
more daring than his comrades, planed up
parallel with them, shouting in German:</p>

<p>“Who are you, aeronauts?”</p>

<p>Bob answered him from one of the outer
runways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[183]</span></p>

<p>“Friends from Przemysl with a wounded
soldier,” he shouted through a megaphone.
“We want to alight in the city as near the
largest hospital as possible. Will you show us
the way?”</p>

<p>“What is the code word?” questioned the
circling Austrian aviator, still suspicious.</p>

<p>“The Double-headed Eagle and a Third
Crown,” replied Bob, as instructed by the
governor.</p>

<p>This apparently satisfied the airman, who at
once passed the word to his flying companions
and the whole crowd of aircraft descended upon
the city like a flock of sparrows settling down
upon a telegraph wire. The Austrian flyers
guided the <em>Ocean Flyer’s</em> direction of descent.</p>

<p>A landing was successfully accomplished in the
Prater, which is a vast expanse of wood and
park on the east side of the city between the
river Danube and the Danube “canal.” Here
in former times the fashionable and the blue-blooded
rolled in stately carriages along the
Haupt-Allee, and the light-hearted, pleasure-loving
middle-classes whiled away their time
boisterously in the Wurstel Prater.</p>

<p>Now all was very different though. This
plaisance of indolent fashion was changed to a<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
military aviation field. Flimsily constructed
plank hangars dotted the terraces all around the
celebrated Rotunda, and wireless apparatus
towered gaunt and skeleton-like into the air.
High-powered automobiles, driven with reckless
speed, were rushing between there and the city
across the canal.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to relate here the astonishment
and curiosity of the Austrian aviators
over the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> as it finally alighted in
their midst. Alan was selected to remain in
charge of it, while the three other boys and the
wounded Racoszky were whirled rapidly into
Vienna in one of the waiting automobiles. On
the way Bob told the two officers who accompanied
them the pathetic story of the invalid,
and they were at once all sympathy for him.</p>

<p>“Since the old count is the sort of man you
say he is, you will probably find him to-morrow
dawdling in the ‘Inner City’ where the palaces
are, or else driving here along the Ringstrasse,”
said one of the officers. “You may not believe
it, sir, but practically no steps have been taken
to fortify Vienna here against capture. The
military aviation corps is supposed to guard
aerial approach, and nobody save the good old
Emperor seems to take other dangers seriously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[185]</span></p>

<p>“Our nobility is too pleasure-loving, too loath
to acknowledge responsibility. To-day, with all
of our outside territory in the throes of a death
struggle, with three nations across our borders,
and with the ugly rumble of national revolution,
the fashionables still parade grandly about,
affecting to ignore conditions. Last week there
were bread riots and the scum of the city’s
alleys and back streets sacked shops throughout
the Leopoldstadt district. It took two regiments
of soldiers to drive them back. Conspiracy is
rank around us; pestilence stalks abroad through
the byways. I hear that Bohemia is already in
revolt. No one knows what terrible disaster will
come in the next news from the front.</p>

<p>“The aged Emperor can do nothing but sit
there in the Hofburg, while his peers, fled here
in terror from all other parts of the kingdom,
spend their time in the gambling casinos, dance
as if frenzied in the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zinspaeleste</i> or, believing
the end of the world at hand, are lost to religion,
morality and the commonest decencies of mankind
in debauching there in the Tabarin and
vice-sinks like it.</p>

<p>“All day long they ride in landaus with silk
parasols, lap-dogs and frippery, where cavalry
divisions should be maneuvering. Silk hats are<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
seen where helmets ought to gleam. The cane
is more widely flourished here than the sword!
But ‘drink and be merry, for to-morrow we
die.’”</p>

<p>As the indignant officer paused in his tirade,
the automobile wheeled into the Alsergrund
district and in a few seconds more was at the
foot of the great flight of gray stone stairs
leading up to the official military hospital.</p>

<p>“We want to get a light, airy, private room
for Lieutenant Racoszky,” Ned explained to the
tired, white-uniformed attendant who met them.</p>

<p>He shook his head wearily, shrugged his
shoulders and replied patiently:</p>

<p>“That is what they all say. Each day I hear
it hundreds of times&mdash;as if there were room
in all of the Alsergrund for half the sick in
Vienna! Is this one of the plague-ridden too?”</p>

<p>Finally, however, accommodations were found
for poor Racoszky, and the boys left, promising
to return on the morrow. The officers then
escorted them to their military headquarters,
where their story had to be retold before they
were given the liberty of the city. They told too
of the gallant defenders in Przemysl and evoked
loud cheers from all who heard them.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed one old soldier, “would<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
that I were there to die a hero’s death with
them, rather than standing guard over this
madhouse here!”</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the night was still young, the
boys decided to look about the city a bit before
returning to Alan and the <em>Flyer</em> out in the
Prater. In a rented taxicab they toured the city
and found conditions much as they had been
described to them. All of the street lamps,
cafes, dance halls and places of amusement
were ablaze with light and thronged with patrons
as if on a gala night. The dreamy strains of a
Strauss or Gungel waltz were weirdly intermingled
with the barbaric staccato of banjorines
thrumming the latest tango.</p>

<p>The shocked and astounded boys sat for a
few moments in the gallery surrounding one of
the huge dance pavilions where hilarity was at
its height. The babel of incongruous noises
beat all around them, but every now and then
during a momentary lull in the clamor, they
were conscious of a subdued conversation going
on at an adjacent table.</p>

<p>The four men who sat there were neither noisy
nor bent on amusement. That was plain. One
was of gigantic physique and wore a huge black,
bristly beard. One was short and unwholesomely<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
fat. He had pouches under his wicked
little pig’s eyes and his skin was blotchy. On
his one hand three rings set with magnificent
jewels sparkled. The third man was evidently
from a different social class, for his hands were
stubby, with black-rimmed finger nails and a
loose, brutal mouth. The fourth man at the table
sat with his back to the boys and wore a cape
pulled high up so as almost completely to muffle
his face. They all were leaning with heads close
together over the table, scarcely having tasted
the wine in their glasses.</p>

<p>Ned, who sat nearest to them, at one time
heard the little fat man with the rings, saying:</p>

<p>“... best done as you say.
To-morrow night I know from His Excellency
the Grand Chancellor that A Certain Distinguished
Personage will remove for the week-end
to the imperial chateau of Schoenbrunn.
That is only fifty-five minutes run by motor car
from the Hofburg and certainly we can&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The blare of music beneath the gallery as the
giddy dance resumed, drowned his further
utterance. By and by, though, Ned again caught
a disjointed phrase or two:</p>

<p>“... only a guard of ten Hussars ... servants
in the chateau all bribed.<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
We’re sure of them ... he sleeps
ordinarily in that suite in the southwest wing,
easily reached by a ladder against the wall....
No! no! Don’t use your knife,
Ottaker, you fool! He is so old and feeble that
a good minute’s grip on his windpipe will
finish him!”</p>

<p>“And the Lerchenfeld cathedral chimes will
go ‘<em>Ding, dong, ding! Ding, dong, ding!</em> Franz
Joseph dead! Franz Joseph&mdash;&mdash;’”</p>

<p>Both the fat little man and he of the enveloping
cape swung quickly around and eyed the near-by
boys sharply. Ned met their scrutiny innocently
enough.</p>

<p>The iron jaw and full eyes of the man in the
cloak impressed themselves indelibly upon his
memory.</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted the fat man, as he turned,
back to his companions.</p>

<p>“They don’t matter&mdash;only young boys&mdash;maybe
tourists caught over here by the war!”</p>

<p>Ned furtively motioned Bob Russell closer
to him.</p>

<p>“Bob,” he whispered, “those men are talking
in French, although they are every one Austrians,
and I can understand them.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” asked Bob, puzzled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[190]</span></p>

<p>“Just this!” breathed Ned. “They are
plotting to assassinate the Emperor to-morrow
night!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ON THE TRAIL OF THE CONSPIRATORS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The effect of this announcement upon the boys
was of course electrical.</p>

<p>“Quick!” whispered Buck to his companions,
“let’s get right out of here and call the police.
We’ll nab the scoundrels as they try to leave.”</p>

<p>“No, sit still, Buck,” Ned said in an equally
cautious tone. “The arrest of these four conspirators
wouldn’t necessarily stamp out the
plot. For as bold and big a scheme as this, there
must also be a good many others implicated. It
may be more important to capture them than
these fellows. Besides, even if we were to call
in the police and have these four arrested, we
couldn’t actually prove anything against them.”</p>

<p>“True enough,” agreed Bob. “What do you
propose to do, Ned?”</p>

<p>“This: I’ll sit quietly here. You and Buck
get up leisurely, bid me good night and appear
to leave. Instead of that, each of you secrete
himself somewhere near the bottom of the stairs
leading up to this gallery. When the men here<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
get up to leave, I’ll follow the man with the
cape muffled around his face, and you boys each
take one of the others.”</p>

<p>“But there are four of them and only three
of us,” objected Buck.</p>

<p>“That’s all right. I don’t think that the
shabby man with the dirty finger nails is anything
more than a mere tool anyhow, so we can
afford to let him go. You, Bob, shadow the
little fat man with the rings, you, Buck,
trail the fellow with the big black beard. Follow
them around all night if necessary, but make
sure that you trace them to their homes finally.
We can all meet with Alan at the <em>Ocean Flyer</em>
over in the Prater at, say, sunrise by the latest.”</p>

<p>This scheme struck the other boys as feasible
and soon Bob and Buck drifted off as arranged,
leaving Ned alone at the table. He had sat
there, seemingly half asleep, for perhaps ten
minutes more, when the four conspirators arose
from their table together and started down the
stairs. Ned followed slyly at a safe distance,
screened by the jostling crowd.</p>

<p>All four men passed out of the place in
company, chatted for a minute or two at the
street entrance and then parted. The ruffianly
looking individual plunged straightway into the<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
nearest alley, after a furtive look behind him.
The pudgy man with the wicked pig’s eyes and
bejeweled rings took a taxicab at the curb stall
and chugged away, followed by Bob in a second
taxi. The herculean black-beard, after leisurely
lighting a cigar, walked aimlessly a little way
down the thoroughfare; paused and felt of his
hip pocket as if to make sure that something
quite important was still there; and at last he
too hailed a taxicab and disappeared, with Buck
still in his wake.</p>

<p>The fourth conspirator&mdash;he who kept his face
so carefully concealed in the collar of his cape&mdash;stood
thoughtfully in the lighted doorway of the
dance hall until all of his companions were gone.
Then he glanced with affected nonchalance at
the faces in the crowd around him and turning,
strolled slowly westward along the street. Ned
followed.</p>

<p>At the second square the man suddenly
quickened his pace until it was all that Ned could
do to keep up with him. At the fifth square, he
all at once wheeled about abruptly and stared
after him; then plunged into an ill-lighted side
street. By the time that Ned got to the corner,
the quarry was just turning the next corner,
running at top speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[194]</span></p>

<p>Ned sprinted after him, turned the corner
and found himself again on a brightly-lighted
thoroughfare thronged with revelers. The man
had vanished into the crowd. Bitter disappointment
choked Ned until suddenly he saw his man
again, this time on the opposite side of the
street, hesitating as if at a loss which way to
go. Finally he again turned westward, with Ned
keeping closer on his heels this time.</p>

<p>Thus the pursuit went on for more than an
hour’s time. Had not the boy been himself a
good walker, the man would soon have tired him
out. The chase ended at last in what your
Viennese calls “Die Innere Stadt,” (The Inner
Town) which lies in the heart of the city and
is the most aristocratic section. The Hofburg,
or Imperial Palace is there, the palaces of many
of the nobility, the government offices, the now
abandoned foreign legations, the opera house
and principal hotels.</p>

<p>The man in the cloak strode swiftly past the
hotel section into the palatial residence district.
He now had the manner of one who knew exactly
where he was going and was in a hurry to get
there.</p>

<p>At the gates of a great iron fence enclosing
the park-like grounds of one of the palatial residences<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
with which the street was lined, the
stranger paused, then entered without a glance
behind him. Ned followed him swiftly up the
gravel walk, to drop flat behind a spreading rosebush
as his quarry wheeled like a flash and stood
stock still, staring intently back at the street.</p>

<p>For a few moments the boy dared scarcely
to breathe. Then, to his relief, the man again
turned, but instead of mounting the imposing
flight of stone steps, flanked by two carved lions
bearing an armorial crest in their mouths, he
slipped a key into a little half-concealed postern
door and vanished inside, leaving the door
slightly ajar behind him.</p>

<p>Ned hesitated but an instant, then himself
plunged into the yawning black hole. It was so
dark that he had to grope his way forward with
hands outstretched in front of him, shuffling his
feet along, one after the other. Scarcely had
he gone three steps forward when two muscular
hands closed around his throat from behind,
half strangling him, and a heavy voice boomed
through the narrow confines of the entry:</p>

<p>“Ho! Emil, Oscar, Friedrich! This way!
Hurry! I have caught a burglar!”</p>

<p>Ned’s sight began to blur. There was a loud
buzzing in his ears and sparks of red, vivid blue<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
and yellow light danced before his eyes. He
was helpless in the iron clutch of the man behind
him. Then came the heavy sound of running
feet and three husky servants in livery arrived
and overpowered him. One tripped him flat on
his face, while the others bound his arms immovably
to his sides with a piece of rope. They
mauled him about and gave him a couple of
kicks for good measure.</p>

<p>“Bring him up here,” commanded the master
of the house abruptly, leading the way up a
narrow little flight of stairs.</p>

<p>As Ned stumbled upward, pushed by the
excited serving-men, he saw for the first time
that a very comely young woman was standing
at the head of the staircase, with a loose dressing
gown thrown around her, just as if she had been
frightened from her bed by the noise of the
scuffle and shouts below stairs.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here, Marya?”
demanded the mysterious man in the cape in
what seemed to Ned to be an unjustifiably gruff
tone. “Why aren’t you in bed where you
belong at this hour?”</p>

<p>The girl’s hands were pressed to her heart,
but she was making a brave effort to conceal
her agitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[197]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I thought&mdash;I hoped that&mdash;father?”
This last in piteous appeal.</p>

<p>The man in the cloak scowled savagely and
shoved her aside, while he and his men pushed
Ned into a large, sumptuously furnished room.</p>

<p>“I know what you thought well enough,” he
growled. “You thought that Racoszky, that
scoundrelly husband of yours, had come and tried
to see you secretly. That’s what you thought!
Well, you are a fool and, though I’m ashamed to
say it, a daughter of mine at the same time.
Look at him as much as you want, Marya! You
see that this doesn’t happen to be your husband.
Instead, he is a rascally fellow who&mdash;you can
go now, men!” The servitors went out silently.
“Instead of that, he is a fellow who has been
dogging my footsteps for the last hour or so
and whom I trapped at the foot of the stairs
there just to find out who he was and why he
has followed me in this way.”</p>

<p>Ned did not quail before the menace in his
captor’s eye. Instead it is to be doubted if he
even had heard his last words. One poignant
thought was ringing through his head:</p>

<p>Marya? The man in the cloak whom he knew
to be a conspirator was her father and he had
called her the wife of Lieutenant Racoszky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[198]</span></p>

<p>Then this would-be assassin was none other
than old Count Polnychek of Budapest!</p>

</div>


<p>It was about half-past eleven when Alan,
nervously pacing the outside runways of the
<em>Ocean Flyer</em> there on the Prater, heard Buck
Stewart’s welcome voice greet him cheerily from
the darkness.</p>

<p>“Are the others back here yet?” asked the
reporter.</p>

<p>“What! Aren’t they with you?” exclaimed
Alan, peering through the gloom. “Where on
earth have you fellows been all night? I got
as nervous as a girl thinking that something
might have happened to you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” drawled Buck, enjoying Alan’s impatient
curiosity, “we did bump into a little
adventure.”</p>

<p>Then he went on to give Alan the details of
their chance discovery of the plot to assassinate
the aged Emperor Franz Joseph on the following
evening.</p>

<p>“Bob followed one man, Ned another, and I
the third&mdash;a gigantic chap who could almost<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
pulverize me with a single blow. I followed
him about for an hour or more, going to first
one low dive and then to another, but always in
the poorer, more squalid sections of the city
where there were few street lamps and where
the second stories of ramshackle old houses
nearly met overhead. The smells were awful,
and every street corner had its individual knot
of evil-looking loafers being harangued by wild-eyed,
long-haired chaps, looking as if they would
cut one’s throat for a nickel. Each demagogue
was working his little gang of listeners up to a
point of frenzy. Some of the orators were
preaching socialism, others a reversion to pious
living. Some waved their arms in an impassioned
plea for absolute anarchy; still others stood on
old soap boxes, with thin lips that alternately
sneered or snarled, preaching atheism, revolution,
murder.</p>

<p>“You may well believe that I wasn’t at all at
ease passing through throngs of that sort all the
while and having to stop every now and then
because Black-beard’s taxi did, while he leaned
out of the window to note the attitude of the
rabble. Once in a while he would be recognized
by persons loitering in the street-corner aggregations.
Several times men sidled slyly up to his<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
taxicab and seemed to be making reports or
getting fresh instructions from him.</p>

<p>“I followed my man around that way for
more than two hours without anything in particular
happening, and finally trailed him to bed at
a middle-class boarding house in the Neyban
district. Then I came on back here.”</p>

<p>The last words were hardly out of his mouth
before Bob Russell joined them, his manner
triumphant.</p>

<p>“Hello, boys!” cried he. “I don’t know
what luck you may have had, but I ran my little
fat man to ground and have found out enough
about him to hang him higher than Haman.”</p>

<p>“Tell us about it,” both boys said.</p>

<p>Bob continued:</p>

<p>“It turned out that the man I followed was
so eminent a dignitary of the realm that I
myself now can hardly believe it to be true.
The chase in the taxicab led me straight into the
‘Inner Town’ and to the very steps of the
Hofburg itself. My man paid off his chauffeur
and went on up the grand stairway with all the
assurance of proprietorship. Liveried lackeys
saluted him respectfully on all sides, but the
gorgeously uniformed guards at the entrance
stopped me when I tried to follow him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[202]</span></p>

<p>“‘It’s all right, my man,’ I tried to explain,
in my best Austrian, ‘I am with&mdash;’ pointing
after the vanishing figure&mdash;‘him.’</p>

<p>“The guardsman raised his eyebrows in
polite disbelief.</p>

<p>“‘But His Excellency the Chancellor did not
tell us that you were accompanying him.’</p>

<p>“‘<em>His Excellency the Chancellor?</em>’ I nearly
fell over backwards when I heard that this arch-conspirator
was <em>he</em>. Then in reckless spirit of
bravado and with a fine assumption of haughtiness,
I said:</p>

<p>“Go ask him. Bring him back here, and
mind that you do not keep me waiting long
either!”</p>

<p>“Impressed by my tone, one of the guardsmen
went in after my quarry, who came back
with a face that was like a mask.</p>

<p>“‘You wished to see me, sir?’ he queried,
taking me in from head to foot at a single
glance.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said I, ‘you forget that I am with
you.’</p>

<p>“‘Ah!’ said he, without exhibiting the
slightest interest. ‘I have indeed forgotten.
Will you not enter with me? His Imperial
Highness is waiting now.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[203]</span></p>

<p>“‘No, I must leave you now,’ I told him.
‘We shall see the Emperor again <em>to-morrow
night</em>, I think.’</p>

<p>“For a brief second his brows knit in a
puzzled frown. Then his face cleared and he
bowed very graciously.</p>

<p>“‘Until then, good friend,’ he murmured.</p>

<p>“‘Until then, your Excellency,’ I parroted
and, turning, descended the steps with all of the
dignity that I could muster. So here I am
again.”</p>

<p>“Well, of all the unmitigated nerve!” Alan
burst forth. “Now I see how it is that you
newspaper men get your ‘stories.’ It’s a wonder
that he didn’t either have you kicked downstairs
or thrown into prison on general principles!”</p>

<p>“He was suspicious all right,” grinned Bob,
who was highly pleased with himself, “but he
didn’t dare risk forcing my hand too strongly
there with all of the servants standing about.
Believe me, though, I’ve given him something
to think about!”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand why Ned doesn’t show
up,” broke in Bob. “It’s past sunrise now.
What can be delaying him?”</p>

<p>The anxiety in Bob’s tone was reflected in the
faces of the other two boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[204]</span></p>

<p>The hours dragged slowly by. Broad daylight
came and wore on to noon. Still no sign of Ned.
Late afternoon found his chums pacing restlessly
up and down the area about the <em>Ocean Flyer</em>.
No one of them dared voice his fears to the
others. The sun’s rays became more slanting;
the shadows longer and heavier. And still no
Ned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The man with the cloak, Count Polnychek,
whirled his captive around facing him with a
heavy grip on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“So?” cried he, “I know you now! You
sat with two others at an adjacent table there in
the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">tanzenhaus</i>! You are a spy then? You
were eavesdropping on our conversation. Did
it interest you so much that you were constrained
to follow me all this distance?”</p>

<p>“It interested me,” said Ned shortly, meeting
his glare coolly, eye to eye. His calmness
enraged the old count still more.</p>

<p>“And what did you hear, you snake?” he
growled, stepping closer and thrusting his
bearded face close to that of the undaunted boy.
“Quick now! Tell me what you overheard!”</p>

<p>“It would be no news to you, Count Polnychek,
of Budapest,” said Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[205]</span></p>

<p>“Donnerwetter! You even know my name
then! You show your teeth to me, do you? Are
you aware that your life is wholly at my mercy?”</p>

<p>Ned disdained to answer him.</p>

<p>“Will you tell me how much you know?”</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>“Marya!”</p>

<p>The distracted girl jumped with fright at the
explosive force of the command.</p>

<p>“Marya, heat your poker in the flames of the
fireplace and then bring it here to me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, father&mdash;dear father, no! no! no! Not
that! You wouldn’t torture this poor boy?”
she pleaded.</p>

<p>The old wretch snarled savagely at her as he
ripped open the bosom of Ned’s shirt, showing
the soft, white skin underneath.</p>

<p>“Did you hear me, Marya!”</p>

<p>Trembling violently, the girl did his bidding.
Shortly the white-hot iron was glowing in his
threatening hand. He held it so close to Ned’s
shrinking flesh that the heat it gave off was
almost intolerable.</p>

<p>“Now will you tell?”</p>

<p>The boy shut his eyes and with gritted teeth
awaited the scorching touch upon his chest. But
it never came. A harsh voice that one would<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
never have recognized as that of the girl who
a few minutes before had cowered in terror,
said:</p>

<p>“Father, throw up your hands, or, as there
is a hereafter, I will shoot you with your own
revolver!”</p>

<p>Marya Racoszky stood with one arm steadily
pointing a huge revolver at her parent’s head.</p>

<p>“Drop that poker!”</p>

<p>He did so. The iron fell into the thick woof
of the carpet, sizzling and causing a vile odor.</p>

<p>Still covering the astounded old wretch with
her weapon, the girl sidled over to Ned and
slashed the rope from off his arms with a penknife.
Instantly she shoved the revolver into
the boy’s hands and collapsed swooning into the
nearest chair. Ned kicked the smoking poker
over into the fireplace. A grim smile edged
his lips.</p>

<p>“Now will <em>you</em> tell <em>me</em> the things that you
know are planned for to-morrow night out at
the Schoenbrunn chateau where Franz Joseph
will spend the night?” he asked sternly.</p>

<p>“<em>No!</em> Shoot if you wish, but I never desert
my comrades. I am a man of honor.”</p>

<p>“‘A man of <em>honor</em>?’ You, who in cold
blood contemplate the assassination of your<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
sovereign&mdash;a poor old man, already shattered
in health and spirit over the miseries of his
country? You are a disgrace to the ancient
name you bear!”</p>

<p>Old Count Polnychek winced under the scathing
scorn in the boy’s voice. The red blood suffused
his deeply lined face.</p>

<p>“You would not dare insult me in this way
were I not unarmed and at your mercy.”</p>

<p>“How about when you threatened to scar
me with that hot poker? Count, you are&mdash;<em>keep
away from that bell or I fire!</em>&mdash;are going to do
my will this time. Let us sit down while you
tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tausend Teufeln</i>, no!”</p>

<p>“I said <em>sit</em>!”</p>

<p>The Count plumped down abjectly into the
depths of a big easy chair. Ned likewise seated
himself, with the ugly-looking revolver still
ready.</p>

<p>“Now, Count,” said he evenly.</p>

<p>“N&mdash;no!”</p>

<p>“Now!”</p>

<p>Old Count Polnychek shrank before the rising
black muzzle not two yards away.</p>

<p>“Well, a curtained limousine is to call here
for me at ten to-night. The chauffeur understands<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
that he is to drive me to Spvodka, ten
minutes’ walk from the chateau where the
Emperor is to sleep. All ten of us who head the
plot are to meet there at eleven. Then
we are to ...”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">AN ATTEMPT TO ASSASSINATE THE EMPEROR</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Alan, Bob and Buck were nearly frantic with
worry over the still-missing Ned by the time
darkness closed in.</p>

<p>“If any harm has come to that boy,” vowed
Buck fiercely, “I swear that I’ll leave no stone
unturned until I find out the guilty parties and
punish them!”</p>

<p>Bob bit his lip gloomily.</p>

<p>“We’re all hoping for the best, of course,”
said he, “and really I believe that Ned can take
care of himself all right.”</p>

<p>“A knife in the back&mdash;a blow from a dark
doorway as he passed&mdash;any of a score of possibilities
here,” muttered Buck.</p>

<p>Alan shuddered and made a desperate effort
to change the conversation.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do to frustrate this
plot on the Emperor’s life!” he asked. “If
we do anything on that, it must be pretty soon,
because time is flying, and I recall that Ned
overheard them say at that other table that the<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
meeting hour had been set for eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” chorused the other boys.
“We mustn’t let our anxiety for Ned permit us
to neglect the other thing. How shall we go
about it?”</p>

<p>They missed their chum’s ready foresight in
planning a course of action then, but, on the
whole, did succeed in mapping out a pretty fair
course of procedure. It was Bob Russell’s idea.
He said:</p>

<p>“Ned stated that some of the servants in the
chateau had been bribed into sympathy with the
conspirators and will admit them secretly into
the house. The man with the big black beard
and he of the twisted mouth were to slip into
the sleeping Emperor’s bedchamber through a
window reached by a ladder against the wall.
The Emperor was to be strangled.</p>

<p>“Now what I suggest is that we use the
<em>Ocean Flyer</em> to get there. Landing some distance
away so as not to be heard from the chateau, we
can then lie in wait hidden by the lawn shrubbery
until the miscreants arrive. We can then pounce
upon them and nip the murder right in the bud.”</p>

<p>“Would it not be better first to warn the
inmates of the chateau of what is afoot?” asked
Alan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[211]</span></p>

<p>“No, that wouldn’t do at all, because neither
we nor the Emperor know which of the attendants
are faithful and which are treacherous.
We’ll have to play this game single-handed,
boys.”</p>

<p>So finally it was agreed to adopt the scheme
as originally suggested by Bob. Their preparations
for departure at that hour of the night
were noted with great curiosity by the other
aviators from the Austrian hangars, and Capt.
von Schleinitz, the young officer who had driven
to the hospital with them and told them about
local conditions when they first arrived, said
casually:</p>

<p>“You choose a peculiar hour for starting off
again, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Bob answered him, “we are only
going on a small flight. Mr. Napier is not
returned yet, so we will, of course, be back for
him.”</p>

<p>“How I wish that I might be privileged to
accompany you on one of your flights!”</p>

<p>Alan and Buck overheard his remark, and after
excusing themselves for the seeming discourtesy,
took Bob aside.</p>

<p>“Listen, Bob,” Alan whispered. “Why not
take Captain von Schleinitz along with us on<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
to-night’s expedition. He impresses me as a
brave, good fellow, and the presence of a regular
Austrian army officer aboard might prove of
great help in several ways. Patrolling military
aeroplanes might stop us with all sorts of questions
once we get into the air.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right, Alan,” said Bob
thoughtfully. “Let’s take him into our confidence
then and explain the whole matter.”</p>

<p>This was accordingly done. The Austrian was
horrified by the revelation of the plot and urged
all possible haste. By ten-thirty the <em>Flyer’s</em>
engines were started and the short flight to
Schoenbrunn was begun. No lights were shown
aboard as the boys were anxious to avoid all
unwelcome attentions.</p>

<p>No attempt was made to hinder their progress,
and a landing was made almost noiselessly not
far from the enclosed gardens of the chateau.</p>

<p>No one of the boys was willing to be left
behind in charge of the airship while the others
went forward into the adventure, yet it was
imperative that someone should stay. After
considerable heated discussion it was finally
decided to draw lots. This method determined
upon Buck as the one to remain behind, which he
submitted to with much disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[213]</span></p>

<p>Alan, Bob and Captain von Schleinitz gripped
his hand hard in a last good-bye, and slipped
stealthily away into the darkness. Buck was
left alone.</p>

<p>There was no moon visible that night. The
sky lowered with the threat of storm, streamers
of clouds scudded as if frightened before the
strong wind. In a near-by marsh the frogs and
crickets made melancholy music. Afar off to
the right somewhere a dog howled mournfully.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nine cloak-shrouded figures stood in close
conference at the Spvodka turnpike, a bare ten
minutes’ walk from the Chateau Schoenbrunn.
Their manner was mysterious, sinister. They
were impatiently waiting for someone.</p>

<p>Far down the road the purr of a motor could
be heard, growing rapidly lower. Suddenly it
ceased altogether and a tenth sepulchral figure
stalked towards them through the gloom.</p>

<p>A subdued murmur of satisfaction greeted his
approach.</p>

<p>“At last you are here, Count Polnych&mdash;”</p>

<p>A quick hand was clapped over the mouth of
the big black-bearded man who spoke.</p>

<p>“Hush, you fool! No names here!”</p>

<p>The newcomer did not address the others, but<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
with a finger to his lips enjoining silence, he led
them towards where the high walls enclosing the
grounds of the Chateau Schoenbrunn loomed up
through the darkness.</p>

<p>Tiptoeing close to the huge iron gates, the
leader of the band shoved gently. The ponderous
gate swung inwards upon hinges that had been
freshly greased to preclude all danger of squeaking.
Just inside the gates a sentry lay securely
bound and gagged on the damp grass. The
chateau servants had earned their blood money.</p>

<p>Alan, Bob and von Schleinitz were crouched
behind the thick shrubbery so near that they
could have reached out and touched the stealthy
intruders. Revolvers were held ready for
instant use.</p>

<p>“Look!” whispered Bob. “The huge bearded
man there is the one whom Buck trailed down.
There is the thug with the twisted mouth. That
fat little man shivering in the wind is the
Grand Chancellor and&mdash;yes, by Jove! That
fellow there who seems to be giving them directions
is the very man whom Ned set out to follow.
If he is here, where is poor Ned?”</p>

<p>The tall man whom the conspirators had
addressed as “count” did very little talking.
At a signal from him, Black-beard and Twisted<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
Mouth slipped away around the corner of the
chateau, and the remainder of the band slunk
noiselessly over the grass to where the silent
black pile of the building showed through the
trees.</p>

<p>Alan, Bob and von Schleinitz skulked close at
their heels, dodging from bush to tree-trunk, to
shrub. It was harrowing work.</p>

<p>Once a stone crunched under Bob’s foot as he
darted across a gravel path.</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>The group of conspirators had whirled about
in consternation, weapons shining dully in their
hands. Only a deathly stillness rewarded their
listening, however. Finally the little fat man,
who was chancellor of the realm, laughed
nervously.</p>

<p>“Bah! It was nothing! We are unstrung
to-night,” he said in a low tone. “But
to-morrow&mdash;”</p>

<p>Evil anticipation lit up the faces of his
companions.</p>

<p>“Ready now!” whispered he whom they had
called “count.”</p>

<p>The ten of them slipped through the unlocked
door into the house where the aged Emperor
slept all unconscious of the hands at his throat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE MAN IN THE CLOAK SURPRISES EVERYBODY</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Franz Joseph, the aged Emperor of Austria-Hungary&mdash;whose
life history is one of the most
tragic of all contemporary royalty&mdash;tossed
uneasily as he slumbered on the great four-posted
bed, around which heavy damask curtains
had been drawn, shutting off all view of the
bed chamber. The Emperor had fled here to
his Chateau Schoenbrunn for at least a day or
so of quiet and ease from the heavy cares of
state.</p>

<p>“Go, your Imperial Highness, and sleep in
peace,” his trusted friend the Grand Chancellor
had told him. “For the time being I will take
the burden from your shoulders.”</p>

<p>“There are couriers waiting there in the ante-room,
from Plotz and the army at Lublin. There
is a messenger from the routed army before
Belgrade. There is yet another ultimatum from
Bulgaria to be considered,” said the aged
monarch doubtfully, passing a listless hand across
his careworn brow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[217]</span></p>

<p>“Highness, cannot I attend to all that?”</p>

<p>The Emperor, broken in spirit and body,
acquiesced weakly.</p>

<p>“<em>Rest!</em>” he murmured, as if invoking a saint,
“undisturbed slumbers and a few hours in
which to forget a bleeding, beaten nation that
cries out for the help I cannot give.”</p>

<p>Thus it was that Franz Joseph came to go to
Schoenbrunn, but forgetfulness did not come to
him with the darkening of the lights around his
bed. The whole sad picture of his reign passed
in review before him like a horrid nightmare&mdash;murdered
relatives, degenerate heirs who had
disgraced his name, and, finally, apparitions of
the Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the Duchess
of Hohenberg, whose assassination by Serbs at
Sarajevo had been used as the excuse for the
war now convulsing the world.</p>

<p>There stood the ghastly shades of the
Emperor’s dearly beloved son and his wife whom
Franz Joseph never would recognize. They
extended bloody, mutilated hands to the old man
and seemed to say:</p>

<p>“See, we are come to take you with us to
where countless thousands of our countrymen
lately have gone. Come, Franz Joseph!”</p>

<p>With a strangling cry of terror, the aged<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
Emperor awoke and half started up in his bed.
At that instant there came quick, catlike footfalls
in the outer rooms, a gurgling shout that
ended in a groan from the halberdiers who kept
watch by the door, and then the heavy curtains
screening the bed were wrenched violently aside
and a terrible figure towered over the palsied
Emperor.</p>

<p>It was Black-beard, his huge, knotty hands
working spasmodically as if already strangling
the poor old man in imagination. Behind him
appeared the villainous visage of the Twisted
Mouth. A knife in his hand was stained red to
the hilt with the life-blood of the door guard
whom they had caught unawares. Behind the
pair the window was open and the upper rungs
of a ladder showed above the sill.</p>

<p>Fate was upon him. The Emperor knew that,
and in that crucial moment when his life seemed
worth but a farthing, the noble bearing of his
forbears came suddenly to him, straightening the
bowed shoulders, throwing back the bent head
and putting the truly regal blaze of eleven generations
of Hapsburgs into his watery eyes.</p>

<p>“Dogs! what do you here in our presence
unannounced?” Franz Joseph thundered, and
even the pajamas covering his wasted form did<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
not detract from the impressiveness of his mien.
“Begone!”</p>

<p>The Emperor pointed one long forefinger from
the wretches to the door.</p>

<p>Neither assassin vouchsafed a word in reply.
Black-beard crouched to hurl himself upon his
defenseless victim when&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Crash!</em> the whip-like report of a revolver
sounded from the doorway and through the
drifting smoke the figure of him they had called
the “count” was visible.</p>

<p>“Perdition!” groaned Black-beard, half-rising
from the floor. “You have killed me,
Polnychek!”</p>

<p>Twisted Mouth had dodged in amazed terror
behind the table, whence he now flourished his
knife uncertainly.</p>

<p>Pandemonium had broken loose below stairs.
Cries of alarm, screams, curses, stentorian commands
mingled with a thunderous fusillade of
shots. The staircase resounded with the rush
of many feet upon it. The treacherous Grand
Chancellor burst wildly into the room. He took
in the scene with one sweeping glance.</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of this, Polnychek?”
he cried threateningly. “Are you playing us
false?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[220]</span></p>

<p>In answer, the “count” dramatically threw
aside the familiar cape and hat which had up to
this time concealed his face. A ferocious curse
burst from the astounded Chancellor.</p>

<div id="Ref_220" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i227.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><em>The Mysterious Man in the Cloak.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Instead of facing Count Polnychek, he was
confronted by the glinting muzzle of a revolver
in the hands of <em>Ned Napier</em>!</p>

<p>What followed thereafter happened far more
swiftly than it can be told. Seeing the entire
plot crumbling about him, and lacking the moral
courage to fight it out, the Chancellor sprang to
an open window and cast himself headlong down
into space. They later found him lying with
his neck broken in the gardens. Twisted Mouth
threw up his hands and surrendered as Ned
advanced upon him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sound of Ned’s shot had
awakened the entire household downstairs.
Weapons were quickly seized and haste was
made to secure the safety of the Emperor. The
faithless servants were among the loudest in
proclaiming their horror of the attempted
assassination.</p>

<p>Alan, Bob and Captain von Schleinitz had
attacked the nine conspirators skulking down
stairs the moment Ned’s shot rang out, and,
although the trapped men fought with unparalleled<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
ferocity, they were driven at bay against
one wall of the building and forced to yield to
their intrepid assailants who were by then reinforced
by thirty or more domestics and imperial
guardsmen.</p>

<p>Owing to the already disturbed conditions in
Vienna it was the Emperor’s wish that all news
of this dastardly attempt on his life be kept
absolutely secret. He rode back along the Ring
Strasse, the main boulevard encircling the city,
in state the next morning and made it a point
to rise up and bow frequently in acknowledgment
of the cheering sidewalk crowds. This
effectually counteracted any premature stories of
his death which might have been circulated in
preparation for the plotted revolution.</p>

<p>The Airship Boys were given a formal
audience in his private reception chamber of the
Hofburg on the following afternoon and Captain
von Schleinitz also was ordered to be present.
The grateful emperor conferred the Order of
St. Stepan upon his faithful officer and promoted
him to the rank of lieutenant colonel of the
Imperial Aviation Corps. To the smiling boys
Franz Joseph said:</p>

<p>“It is a matter of difficulty for me to decide
how best to acknowledge my life-long indebtedness<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
to you young gentlemen. The fact that
you are not of the nobility nor yet soldiers precludes
my decorating you with any of the Orders
of Merit in my power. So, gentlemen, I am
going to leave it for you yourselves to say how
I best may please you.”</p>

<p>Of course all of the boys blushed and were
much embarrassed by such a gracious reception.
None of them knew exactly what to say until
Buck blurted out:</p>

<p>“Why, we wouldn’t think of taking any
rewards ourselves for a thing that it was our
plain duty to do, sir, but we have a favor that
we’d like to ask for a friend who, by the way,
happens to be a subject of yours.”</p>

<p>“Your request is already granted&mdash;even
though the man be one of those implicated in
the conspiracy,” said the Emperor kindly.</p>

<p>“While we were in Przemysl,” continued
Buck, “we met an infantry officer, one Lieutenant
Racoszky, who lay dying in the hospital
for lack of proper attention to his wounds. He
is one of your most devoted subjects.”</p>

<p>Then Buck went on to tell how the lieutenant
had married above his station in life and of his
subsequent misfortunes as a result of the old
count’s brutal enmity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[223]</span></p>

<p>“We want you to intercede with the count
on Racoszky’s behalf and bring the young
couple and their child together again,” Buck
concluded.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stewart hasn’t told you the entire
story yet, though,” Ned here interrupted. “It
seems that Count Polnychek was one of the moving
spirits in this plot. While trailing him down,
I fell into his power and probably would have
been murdered had it not been for his brave
daughter, Racoszky’s wife, who forced him at a
revolver’s muzzle to liberate me.</p>

<p>“Armed with the weapon she had given me,
I forced him to reveal the full details of the
conspiracy and now have him bound and locked
there in his daughter’s room. She agreed to
stand guard over him while I impersonated him
at the conspirators’ rendezvous. The lady has
asked that I beg leniency for her parent in view
of her own great services on your behalf.”</p>

<p>The Emperor paced the room thoughtfully for
a few moments. Then he said:</p>

<p>“Young gentlemen, you shall have both of
your wishes. Lieutenant Racoszky need no
longer dread separation from his family, and
Count Polnychek shall not be accorded the
sentence he so richly deserves. But he must<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
leave Austria at once, and the first time that he
ever again sets foot across our boundaries shall
be the signal for his arrest.”</p>

<p>Thus the happiness of Racoszky was assured
and the boys were left once more free to pursue
their way.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">SURROUNDED BY GERMAN ZEPPELINS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The war had by this time begun to pall upon
the boys, and Alan voiced the sentiments of all
four when he said:</p>

<p>“I’m sick of all this treachery, thunder of
cannon, wails from the wretched common people
and indiscriminate bloodshed. The United
States is good enough for yours truly, and I wish
that I was there right now.”</p>

<p>So it was decided that the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> be
headed homeward without further delay and,
after bidding good-bye to the genial von
Schleinitz and Racoszky and his courageous little
wife, the boys early one morning started their
engines and let the hectic life of Vienna sink into
a miniature panorama far beneath them.</p>

<p>The course was set northwesterly and a
spanking breeze in a murky sky accelerated their
speed.</p>

<p>“Off for America again at last!” shouted
Bob jubilantly, and the other boys echoed him in
three rousing cheers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[226]</span></p>

<p>By ten o’clock, however, there was a marked
change in the atmosphere. The barometer fell
low in the glass, and every delicate instrument
in the pilot room gave ominous indications of
nasty weather.</p>

<p>Ned’s face showed his worry, but he forced
a cheerful smile before his chums.</p>

<p>“It will blow over, I am sure,” he said.</p>

<p>The <em>Flyer</em> was being held to an elevation of
perhaps 2,500 feet. The lower cloud banks cut
off all view of the world beneath, and Alan
suggested that they descend to a lower level
where, although they might feel the effects of
the rainstorm from the clouds, the rapidly
increasing velocity of the wind would not hold
them so surely in its grip.</p>

<p>Ned listened to the demoniacal shrieks of the
wind as the <em>Flyer</em> scudded along, and was not
slow to acknowledge the common sense of Alan’s
advice. So the airship was dropped down to a
considerably lower level below the clouds.</p>

<p>In that region a terrible storm was raging.
The thunder burst in crashes that seemed louder
than ten thousand cannon. The air vibrated
with the shocks. Appalling zigzags of lightning
shot yellow across the sky. The rain fell in
torrents from an inky sky and dashed dismally<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
against the metal sides of the speeding airship.</p>

<p>Being mistrustful of air eddies or whirlpool
currents as a result of the hurricane, Ned
reduced the <em>Flyer’s</em> speed to the minimum. As
he wisely observed, “No use taking unnecessary
chances.”</p>

<p>Thus the big vessel fled before the storm for
half an hour or more when, with astonishing
suddenness, the reverberations of thunder ceased
and the sun turned the rainfall into a fog so
dense that it seemed that the <em>Flyer</em> was cutting
its way through a solid substance. It became so
dark inside that the boys had to turn on the
electric lights.</p>

<p>“I don’t like this at all,” muttered Ned at
last, as he strained his eyes through the mist-clouded
observation-port.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, we aren’t flying low enough
to hit any trees or church steeples,” grinned
Bob.</p>

<p>“No, but all the same I don’t like to keep
going even this slowly through vapor as thick as
this is. If I could only see the character of the
ground below, I’d try to make a landing.”</p>

<p>The earth, however, continued wholly shrouded
and Ned had to hold on his unwilling way.</p>

<p>It was perhaps a quarter of an hour later that<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
Buck, who had been calculating at the speedometer,
and referring to various charts,
announced that the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> was probably
over northern Germany. Shortly afterward the
increasing strength of the sun’s rays began to
dissipate the fog, which assumed fantastic forms
that writhed and squirmed as they floated away
into nothingness. It amused the boys to pick
out these patches of mist and to note their outline
resemblance to one animal or another.</p>

<p>“There’s a cow!” laughed Bob, pointing.</p>

<p>“And over there is a giraffe&mdash;see his long
neck?”</p>

<p>“Look straight ahead, boys, and see the
bologna sausage,” called Ned from his station
at the wheel.</p>

<p>Sure enough&mdash;there it was, gigantic and dull
gray, directly ahead of them. But strange to
say, while it kept moving along in the same
direction as the <em>Flyer</em>, it did not soon dissolve
into thin air. Instead of that it took vast tangible
form. Other vapor forms began to appear
transparent beside it. The vague outlines of
complicated rigging extending down from the
sausage became easily apparent. Then a suspended
metal body, punctured with many
windows, appeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[229]</span></p>

<p>By this time the speeding <em>Ocean Flyer</em> was
almost upon it, and only Ned’s presence of
mind in veering the huge right side planes
abruptly averted a sure collision. The <em>Flyer</em>
swept down past the other huge voyager of the
sky at an acute angle and did not right itself
until a considerable distance below.</p>

<p>“Holy smoke!” gasped Bob. “What is that
curious looking thing?”</p>

<p>Ned was deadly pale, but his lips were pressed
grimly together.</p>

<p>“That, boys,” said he, “is one of the famous
German armored Zeppelins. Look up there to
the left&mdash;three more of them sailing close
together. See over there to the right&mdash;two
more of them. I can see more flitting along
down below us, and I think that there are more
ahead. We have descended into the very midst
of them. Look out for trouble now, because I’ll
bet dollars to doughnuts that this is the long-dreaded
aerial raid upon England!”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE BATTLE ABOVE THE CLOUDS</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Almost before the words had passed Ned’s
lips, an ugly black muzzle was protruded from
a window in the hanging body of the nearest
Zeppelin. Then came a puff of bluish smoke, a
dull roar and flash of flame:</p>

<p>BZZ&mdash;Zz&mdash;z&mdash;z&mdash;z&mdash;z&mdash;z&mdash;z....</p>

<p>A huge shell had passed athwart the <em>Ocean
Flyer’s</em> bows in stern warning for her to stop
and await inspection.</p>

<p>Perspiration started out profusely on the boys’
foreheads. The huge German war balloons were
approaching in a rapidly narrowing circle. There
were at least fifty of them, and soon an advance
patrol of military “Taube” aeroplanes came
skimming back to support them. Cannon were
shoved menacingly out of a score of portholes.
There was no mistaking the determination of the
Germans.</p>

<p>“Heavens!” groaned Alan, his cheeks
blanched. “What shall we do? If we don’t
stop in a minute, they’ll all get our range and<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
blow even our stout magnalium covering to bits.
We haven’t a single weapon on board that can
compare with those heavy cannon!”</p>

<p>“Don’t surrender unless there is absolutely
nothing else for us to do,” cried Buck.</p>

<p>Bob added: “No, because then they’d simply
lock us up in some German prison and use the
<em>Flyer</em> for their raid on England!”</p>

<p>The two nearest Zeppelins could now be seen
letting gas out of their huge sausage-like bags as
they settled down towards the almost stationary
airship. As they changed position, it left a narrow
break in the ring of enemies.</p>

<p>“Shall we risk a chance on breaking through
there? That’s our only hope,” said Ned quietly.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. Quick&mdash;full power ahead before
they think to close the gap!”</p>

<p>Ned jammed the acceleration lever hard down
in its socket; the machinery groaned with the
pressure of too suddenly added power; the
exterior planes folded automatically before
the rapidly increasing rush of air. The <em>Ocean
Flyer</em> swept upwards at an abrupt angle, heading
straight for the only opening left unguarded.</p>

<p>Simultaneously the Zeppelin crews saw the
boys’ desperate intent. Flame belched from
twenty cannon mouths. Shells burst screaming<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
all around. Four light aeroplanes skimmed like
swallows up and over to cover the gap in the
ring. The two huge Zeppelins bearing down
upon the Flyer from above converged and
charged her, head on.</p>

<p>“There’s only one thing for us to do,”
groaned Ned, “and that is to ram them. We can
do it, but it means that the Zeppelins we hit will
be destroyed and with them I don’t know how
many men. Those craft carry a crew of forty
or more, you know.”</p>

<p>“I hate to think of it too, but they themselves
have made it our lives or theirs!” yelled
Alan. “So go to it, Ned.”</p>

<p>The <em>Ocean Flyer</em> had now attained an incredible
velocity. It was only a matter of minutes,
of seconds, or instants, before it would crash
straight into the huge but clumsier enemy
advancing to meet it. There was a bare glimpse
of drawn, panic-stricken faces crowding the
hanging compartment. The pointed snout of the
<em>Flyer</em> tilted suddenly at an eighty-degree angle
and&mdash;</p>

<p><em>B o o m&mdash;m&mdash;m&mdash;psthsh&mdash;sh&mdash;sh&mdash;ss!</em></p>

<p>She had struck and pierced the huge gas bag
of the Zeppelin, leaving a huge, gaping rent from
which the gas rushed as the craft sagged sidewise<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
more and more. Several of the heavy cables
supporting the car from the bag parted with
reports like shell explosions. The Zeppelin began
slowly to sink, while her sister craft sheered off
from the rushing destroyer.</p>

<p>Wild-eyed and remorseful for the awful necessity
of their deed, the boys now saw the light
aeroplanes darting up to block their path. The
futility of their trying to stop an airship when
a Zeppelin twenty times their size had failed,
did not seem to occur to those daring German
aviators.</p>

<p>They sat braced there in their narrow seats
among the intricacy of wire rigging, guiding
their frail craft with one hand and shooting
rapidly with the other. Rifle and revolver bullets
rattled against the <em>Flyer’s</em> magnalium sides like
hailstones.</p>

<p>The rush of wind set in lateral motion by the
velocity of the huge airship nearly capsized two
of the little craft. The planes of a third one
were brushed roughly by the <em>Flyer</em> as it rushed
past.</p>

<p>The sun had now dissipated the last of the
mist and the shapes of the other Zeppelins could
plainly be seen sailing down upon their prey.
The whole sky seemed to be full of them. No<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
wonder England was terrified by such a menace
as this!</p>

<p>The <em>Ocean Flyer</em> now had, however, a clear
field in front of her and the situation resolved
itself into a race to get out of range. Here
was where the tremendous motive power of the
airship stood her in good stead. No Zeppelin
could maintain such a terrific speed as Ned set.</p>

<p>The guns of the Zeppelins roared almost continuously,
but a moving target is hard to hit.
Most of the deadly shells either fell short or
went wide of their mark. One by one the huge
“bologna sausages” began to drop behind and
abandon the pursuit. Finally there were only
two left&mdash;one a quarter of a mile in the rear
and the other hanging almost stationary to the
left of the <em>Flyer’s</em> course. The last Zeppelin had
evidently been foremost of the raiding squadron.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, old chaps,” Bob yelled mockingly,
just as the Zeppelin to the left let fire a broadside
with every one of her seven cannon. The
“kick” of the discharge caused her to careen
backward amid clouds of powder smoke.</p>

<p>Shells droned gruesomely past the speeding
<em>Flyer</em>&mdash;overhead, beneath, on both sides.</p>

<p>A rending thud that hurled the airship on her
beam ends ... the splintering crash of<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
wood and metal ... frenzied cries for help
from Buck down in the engine room. A perceptible
“missing” of the engines and an alarming
tilt to one side.</p>

<p>The <em>Ocean Flyer</em> had been hit!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE MOST TERRIBLE ACCIDENT OF ALL</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“What in goodness’ name is the matter down
there? Where did that shell strike us?” shouted
Ned, anxiously, through the speaking tube, while
both Alan and Bob tumbled downstairs in answer
to Buck’s frantic appeal from the engine room.</p>

<p>“Put on every ounce of pressure you can,”
they signalled up to the boy in the pilot room
presently. He did so, and for a bit the <em>Flyer</em>
showed a spurt of her old speed, leaving the
Zeppelin a dwindling speck in the distance.
Within twenty minutes, however, despite the
application of every power appliance in the
equipment, the speed again began to diminish
until the airship was not making more than
fifteen miles an hour.</p>

<p>As the velocity gradually decreased, the huge
wing-like exterior planes automatically unfolded,
but, to the horror of the boys, no sooner had they
attained full expansion than the whole lateral
series on the right side of the hull collapsed into
mere wreckage, dragging the <em>Flyer</em> violently<span class="pagenum">[237]</span>
over in that direction and hurling the young
aeronauts off their feet.</p>

<p>The bursting shell had indeed done effective
damage. It had struck the armored magnalium
hull just about amidships, ploughed its way
through the metal, leaving a great jagged hole in
the twisted sheets of steel, and had exploded just
outside the engine room, one partition of which
was demolished with various alarming damage to
the machinery. At the same time, some flying
pieces of the exploding shell must have struck
the exterior plane and propulsion mechanism,
snapping the supports and rendering the entire
outside wings wholly useless.</p>

<p>In his confusion, when the right lateral plane
series collapsed, Ned threw on every particle of
power at his command, mindful that an increase
of the vessel’s velocity would cause the disabled
planes to fold away again automatically out of
the wind and so lessen the imminent danger of
overturning. The acceleration was only momentary
though, and the <em>Ocean Flyer</em> seemed in danger
of rolling over sidewise at any minute.</p>

<p>“Ned, shut off ‘juice’ on those main outside
propellers and try to run on the interior auxiliary
propeller!” yelled Buck up the speaking tube.</p>

<p>“That ought to give us a little extra speed while<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
we are trying to cut away the plane wreckage
which is dragging us over sidewise!”</p>

<p>Ned was rattled. He had not thought of that
before, but he instantly did as he was bid.
Despite the damaged mechanism, the <em>Flyer</em>
responded to this new application of power and
speeded up until a fifty mile an hour velocity was
registered on the instruments.</p>

<p>Leaving Buck on his knees beside the half-incapacitated
engines, Alan and Bob seized sharp
axes and rushed out upon the exterior runways
extending two-thirds of the way around the hull.
A cry of astonishment burst from both boys
simultaneously:</p>

<p>“The sea! We are passing out over the
ocean!”</p>

<p>It was true. Dim in the distance behind
them stretched the broken coast line of Germany,
while beneath, to north, to east, to west,
tossed the angry gray waters of the North Sea.
The misty shape of the British Isles lay like a
low-hanging cloud to the southwest. Almost
directly below the airship a huge merchant vessel
could be seen steaming grandly along.</p>

<p>“Say, I wish that we were all down there
aboard that big ship instead of where we are,”
said Allan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[239]</span></p>

<p>“Not for me!” replied Bob, emphatically.
“Don’t you remember hearing how both the
English and Germans have declared an absolute
embargo on all merchant ports and have mined
the entire ocean to interrupt each other’s commerce?
Dangerous as our position up here now
is, I’d lots sooner be here in a crippled airship
than down there.”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, there came a terrific explosion
far down below. Sparks and broken spars
were hurled high. The big merchantman
appeared suddenly to rise straight up on her
beam’s ends. Immense funnels of ocean water
spurted hundreds of feet in the air all around
her and, as the vessel settled down again, she
seemed to snap in the middle and to disintegrate
as if the bolts and bars from every clinch and
support had been suddenly removed. Her stern
began slowly disappearing beneath the churning,
white-crested waves. Fire broke out amidships
and dense volumes of black smoke half
obscured the terrible disaster from the horrified
boys’ view.</p>

<p>They saw the attempted launching of two long
lifeboats. Both were swamped almost before
they had been lowered into the water. The sea
all around the doomed ship became dotted with<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
human heads and floating pieces of wreckage.
Then, all at once, a whirlpool seemed to form
about the ship and to be dragging it resistlessly
down into the icy depths. The water boiled over
it and nothing save a few scattered bits of driftwood
remained to mark the spot.</p>

<p>Alan shuddered and closed his eyes as he
leaned against the <em>Flyer’s</em> taffrail.</p>

<p>“Awful!” he muttered huskily. “All of
those poor souls&mdash;noncombatants at that&mdash;hurled
into eternity without warning or provocation.
Do you suppose that the vessel struck a
submerged mine?”</p>

<p>“Either that or it was torpedoed,” answered
Buck. “They say that the whole North Sea and
English Channel swarms with German submarines
for this sort of thing. But quick now,
Alan; to work cutting us free of these dragging
planes, or we ourselves will soon feel the water
at our necks!”</p>

<p>It was hard work getting through those rivet
supports of the huge planes. Bolts had to be
cut away, steel cables to be sawed through, and
seasoned wood supports hacked away. The boys’
hands became sore and calloused, and their fingers
stiffened. Despite the cold air sweeping
past, their faces were damp with perspiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[241]</span></p>

<p>The airship staggered in bewildering fashion,
but the auxiliary engines kept it going at a speed
that quickly put England beneath them. The
young aeronauts had no leisure to study the
effect of their appearance upon spectators below,
however, for the airship was sagging more and
more surely to one side. Fortunately they passed
over no large towns and so were not fired on.</p>

<p>“At last!” gasped Alan, as with a final
vicious blow he chopped loose the final attachment
of the great lateral planes on his side of
the airships and saw them plunge downward into
the sea.</p>

<p>“Same here!” shouted Bob from the gangway
on the other side. “I’ve just managed to
cut us free over here!”</p>

<p>The beneficial effect of this lightening of the
drag was at once apparent. The <em>Flyer</em> righted
itself and picked up a fair degree of speed. The
elevation was increased to 2,000 feet, where
propulsion was less modified by earthly wind
currents. The little auxiliary propeller was performing
its extra duties gallantly. It was now
getting well along in the afternoon and daylight
was failing rapidly. Far ahead of them showed
a thin rim of silver beyond the dark shadow of
the land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[242]</span></p>

<p>“A river?” questioned Alan.</p>

<p>“The Irish Sea,” replied Ned shortly.</p>

<p>“Where we going to land?” asked Bob, a
bit anxiously.</p>

<p>“It’s not safe here. I had thought of crossing
to the coast of Ireland and following along as
far as our gas holds out&mdash;supply’s running
mighty low&mdash;in the hopes of getting as close
to Queenstown as we dare. Then we’ll drop in
some deserted spot and arrange to ship the <em>Flyer</em>
back, while we get passage out of Queenstown
for good old New York.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t the slightest idea where
we are,” objected Alan.</p>

<p>“We’ll know after we hit land again; we’ll
light long enough to get our bearings. Somebody
go down below and relieve Buck. He must be
about worn out.”</p>

<p>But Buck refused to leave the wrecked engine
room, where, stripped to the waist and grease
from head to foot, he still tinkered with the
faulty-acting machinery. In spite of his efforts
the speed gauge needle steadily shifted back. A
bare twenty miles an hour was all it showed.</p>

<p>Sunset flamed across the sky. Then gloaming
came, and by and by the stars appeared one
by one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[243]</span></p>

<p>Towards midnight there was a perceptible
lessening of the airship’s momentum which no
mechanical efforts of Alan in the pilot room
could counteract. When the velocity had
decreased to ten miles per hour, he grew so
alarmed that he was tempted to call Ned and Bob.</p>

<p>“But no!” said he. “They are worn out,
poor fellows. As long as there’s no land in
sight I’ll let them sleep as long as I dare.”</p>

<p>It was about five in the morning when Buck’s
voice coming up through the speaking-tube
startled Alan out of the doze into which he had
fallen as he sat there at the wheel.</p>

<p>“What is it, Buck?” Alan asked anxiously.
“Nothing new has developed, has there?”</p>

<p>The voice at the other end of the tube was
hoarse with desperation:</p>

<p>“Wake up the other boys! Quick, Alan!
This is the end! The sulphuric ether and gasoline
won’t mix properly in the engines any
longer. Two of the magnalium cylinders are
damaged beyond all hopes of repair and I can’t
get any concussion in the explosion chambers.
The ammonia fans are gradually slowing down
and the turbines are getting red hot. Within
ten minutes more the engines will stop altogether
and we will drop into the sea like so much
lead. This is the last of the <em>Ocean Flyer</em>.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE END OF THE OCEAN FLYER</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Ned and Bob were immediately awakened and
a hasty examination of the engines showed
plainly the terrible truth of Bob’s prophecy.</p>

<p>“We’ll drop like a rock!” he repeated
hoarsely, trying to control the tremor in his voice.</p>

<p>The boys stared at each other, blank horror
in each face.</p>

<p>“Oh, if only we had not been forced to chop
away the big wing planes,” groaned Alan.
“With them spread, the force of our fall would
surely have been checked and given us at least
a fighting chance for our lives!”</p>

<p>“No use of crying over spilt milk,” said Ned.
“We’ve got to decide upon something quickly.
The engines are slowing down now and a fall
of 2,000 feet upon the surface of the Atlantic
will dash us to pieces just as surely as if we hit
bed rock. What can we do?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” answered Bob with grim resignation,
“nothing except to shake hands and tell
each other we hope to meet in the hereafter<span class="pagenum">[245]</span>
again. We are doomed, boys, and you all
know it.”</p>

<p>Outside it was already getting light. Morning
sunlight blushed rosily over the eastern sky, and
the gray tossing surface of the pitiless ocean far
below became dimly visible. At first sight it
appeared to be wholly devoid of any sail, but
closer inspection through the binoculars finally
brought to view a large ship beating its way
toward them, perhaps three miles to the north.
Long streams of smoke hung on the horizon line
in its wake.</p>

<p>“See!” exclaimed Ned. “One of the big
passenger liners&mdash;a Cunarder by her build, I
should guess. If only they were near enough to
see and save us!”</p>

<p>“No hope,” muttered Bob dully.</p>

<p>“<em>The wireless!</em>” yelled Buck, springing suddenly
to his feet. “We can signal to them with
that!”</p>

<p>In a trice he was gone and his nervous fingers
were flashing out a frantic call.</p>

<p>“<em>S. O. S! S. O. S! S. O. S!</em>”</p>

<p>Two more seconds passed. Then a blue electric
spark leaped across the instrument. The big
ocean liner had intercepted the message and was
asking for information.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[246]</span></p>

<p>Buck’s fingers ticked out his plea like lightning:</p>

<p>“Airship falling three miles south of you ... help
quickly ... help quickly.”</p>

<p>The eagerly watching boys by the portholes
could see the effect of this message upon the
distant vessel. Great volumes of black smoke
began to vomit from her three funnels as full
steam ahead was put on. Her course was changed
slightly and she forged as rapidly as might be
in their direction. Tiny black figures could be
seen crowding the decks and rigging of the distant
liner.</p>

<p>The boys were a-quiver with excitement and
hope until a sudden, unaccustomed quiet around
them forced itself upon their notice.</p>

<p>“What is it?” queried Bob.</p>

<p>Ned answered him quietly:</p>

<p>“Boys, the engines have stopped running&mdash;we
are about to fall!”</p>

<p>Each was ashamed to show the mortal fear
that agitated him. White-faced they gripped
hands in silent farewell.</p>

<p>“Hurry now,” Ned cried, in command to the
very last, “run and get into pneumatic life-jackets
and each one lash his hands to the
handle of a parachute. When once the <em>Flyer</em>
begins to drop, we’ll have to jump quick, or the<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>
force of the contrary air will turn our chutes
inside out. Be quick, boys!”</p>

<p>For perhaps three minutes the <em>Ocean Flyer</em>
hung motionless, as if suspended there in the
air. Then she wavered slightly and suddenly
the stupendous plunge straight downwards began.</p>

<p>With each passing second, as earth gravity
took a more relentless hold upon the falling vessel,
the momentum increased until it attained a
velocity past computing. Like a stone it whizzed
down through the whistling air to an unmarked
resting place in the foam-crested waves far below.</p>

<p>All of the four boys jumped wide out from the
outer taffrail the instant the fall began. Their
parachutes spread and bellied to meet the
upward rush of air, which struck the stout
umbrella-like frames with a reactionary force
that nearly tore the boys’ arms from their sockets.
The <em>Ocean Flyer</em> shot swiftly down past
them before their own more gradual descent
became perceptible.</p>

<p>Down, down, down, down, through seemingly
endless space they sank with that intolerable
strain on their arms and the blood pounding
madly at their temples.</p>

<p>Down, down, down!</p>

<p>Ned ventured a hasty glance below him. There<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
swung the big Cunard liner not a quarter of a
mile away. There raced the lifeboats filled with
jackies in white, bending rhythmically to and fro,
while the long oars glistened like silver in the
morning sun. A raucous blast of encouragement
from the liner’s whistles half stunned the senses.</p>

<p>Ned closed his eyes again. It seemed as if he
had been hours floating down through the air.
Had it not been for the stout cords which
secured his blue, swollen wrists to the handle of
the parachute, he could not have kept his hold.</p>

<p>Hearty shouts&mdash;<em>English</em> words&mdash;resounded
almost beneath him. A little puff of wind carried
the parachute off a hundred yards to one
side and then it began sinking again.</p>

<p>Ned felt something icy cold lave, submerge and
rise higher and higher up around his body. It
was the waves.</p>

<p>Up they crept, first to his ankles, then to his
thighs, then above his waist, then closed around
his neck. The parachute collapsed, but the pneumatic
life-jacket buckled around him buoyed Ned
up. The spray buffeted saltily against his mouth
and smarted in his eyes. His body became numb
from the chill of the icy water. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>“All aboard there, mates!” shouted gruff,
cheery voices, and strong hands seized upon Ned<span class="pagenum">[249]</span>
and dragged him half-insensible into the lifeboat.
Alan and Buck were already huddled shivering
there, and Bob was rescued a few minutes later.</p>

<p>Propelled by the powerful arms of sixteen
sailors, the lifeboat fairly leaped over the waves
toward where hundreds of curious, pitying faces
lined the taffrails of the big liner.</p>

<p>“Where are you bound?” asked Bob of the
boatswain.</p>

<p>“From Liverpool to New York, U. S. A.,”
came the cheery answer. “We’ll sight the
Statue of Liberty in the harbor within six days.”</p>

<p>Ned felt the clasp of Alan’s hand in his.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve seen the last of the <em>Ocean
Flyer</em>,” Alan said drearily. “We’ve lost the
finest craft of its kind in existence.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Alan,” answered Ned, renewed
vigor sparkling in his eyes. “We’ve accomplished
all that we set out to do and I promise you that,
back in New York again, we’ll build a brave new
airship beside which the old <em>Flyer</em> would have
seemed like a joke. Remember that we’re now
bound for the ‘land of the free.’”</p>

<p>“And ‘the brave,’” rejoined Bob quickly,
casting an affectionate glance over at Alan and
Buck.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
